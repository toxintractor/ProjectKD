                       "(\"Secret Weapons of WWII\" redirects here. For other uses, see Secret Weapons of World War II.) Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII is the second of two expansions to the World War II first-person shooter computer game Battlefield 1942. It was released for Microsoft Windows 4 September 2003 in North America and 5 September 2003 in Europe. It was also released for OS X on 25 October 2004. Secret Weapons of WWII brings many new features to the original game, such as new weapons, vehicles, battles, factions, and a new gameplay mode that focuses on fulfilling objectives more than destroying the enemy army. These new features help to bring variety to its predecessor's gameplay without overhauling the series. For example, while an Allied engineer may still maintain his original role as being able to repair vehicles, his long-ranged rifle has been replaced with a shotgun, which is effective at short distances."@en ,
                       "(For the film based on this video game, see Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film).) Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person action-adventure puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Ubisoft. First revealed in March 2003, it was released across PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows in November 2003. The Sands of Time is a reboot of the Prince of Persia series, created by Jordan Mechner. Mechner served as creative consultant, designer, and scenario writer for The Sands of Time. The game follows an unnamed Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's city at the instigation of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands as a gift to the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies. Concept work began in spring of 2001, after Ubisoft acquired the Prince of Persia catalog. After Mechner was brought on board, production began in June of that year. After the initial story draft was scrapped as it was too complex, the team began with four guiding concepts, including the ability to rewind time: this idea grew into the Dagger, the Sands, and the various powers related to them. Mechner's script drew inspiration from the Shahnameh, with the main focus on creating a simple narrative that worked with the pace of gameplay. The game used Ubisoft's Jade engine, originally designed for Beyond Good & Evil, another game published by the company. Production was troubled, with the team facing problems with the engine structure and delays with environment assets, while also managing to create an effective tester network to seek out the game's bugs. In 2004, a version for mobile phones was developed and published in North America by Gameloft. Upon release, it received critical acclaim, won and was nominated for numerous awards, and has been recognized by many as one of the greatest games of all time. Sales of the title were initially slow, but it eventually became a commercial success. Its success prompted the development of a sequel, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within, which was released in November 2004. Further games set in the Sands of Time continuity have been developed, and it is generally cited as the reason for the Prince of Persia series' return to fame."@en ,

A version for iOS and Android was released as well in 2011. 428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de is a visual novel set in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo where the narrative is presented using a combination of scrolling text, live action stills and video sequences. The game shares many story and gameplay elements with Chunsoft's 1998 sound novel game Machi, the most prominent being the locale, Shibuya. Although Chunsoft does not openly state 428 is a sequel, the game contains numerous references to Machi, and an early marketing slogan reads \"Breaking a long silence, Shibuya gets going again.\" The game has received high praise from critics, earning a perfect score in Famitsu Weekly, Japan's largest circulating video game magazine. The game also features a special scenario contributed by Kinoko Nasu and Takashi Takeuchi of Type-Moon fame, who wrote and provided character designs for them respectively. It was subsequently announced by Sega that this particular scenario by Type-Moon would be adapted into an anime TV series titled Canaan, which began airing in Japan on July 4, 2009.

                       "Afterlife is a god game released by LucasArts in 1996 that places the player in the role of a semi-omnipotent being known as a Demiurge, with the job of creating a functional Heaven and Hell to reward or punish the citizens of the local planet. The player does not assign citizens to their various punishments and rewards, since the game does this automatically. Instead, the player creates the infrastructure (roads, zones for the various sins/virtues, reincarnation centers) that allows the afterlife to function properly. Players are accountable for the job that they do because their bosses, The Powers That Be, check in from time to time. The player also has the assistance of two advisors—Aria Goodhalo, an angel, and Jasper Wormsworth, a demon. Aria and Jasper provide warnings when things are going wrong with the afterlife, and offer tips on how to fix the problems. The game is very satirical, with various references to pop culture (such as a passing mention of a \"San Quentin Scarearantino\" or sending a Death Star to destroy buildings if the player cheats too much)."@en ,

If the player shoots too soon, he will be hanged for murder. Failing to fire in time, however, will result in being killed by the attack. As the player progresses, the timing becomes more precise.The game was very particular about firing at the right time, which made it very difficult and often unplayable.

The developers licensed the game to Epyx, who published it as Death Sword in the United States. Barbarian is a fighting game that gives players control over sword-wielding barbarians. In the game's two-player mode, players pit their characters against each other. Barbarian also has a single-player mode, in which the player's barbarian braves a series of challenges set by an evil wizard to rescue a princess. Instead of using painted artwork for the game's box, Palace Software used photos of hired models. The photos, also used in advertising campaigns, featured Michael Van Wijk (who would later become famous as 'Wolf' in the TV series Gladiators) as the hero and bikini-clad Maria Whittaker, a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid's Page Three topless photo shoots. Palace Software's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom, with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game. The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarian's profile, helping to make it a commercial success. Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat, and dashes of humour. The game was Palace Software's critical hit; boosted by Barbarian's success, Palace Software expanded its operations and started publishing other developers' work. In 1988, the company released a sequel, Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax."@en ,

It was released in October 2013. The game features Jodie Holmes, one of two player characters. The other is an incorporeal entity named Aiden: a separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by actress Ellen Page, possesses supernatural powers through her psychic link to Aiden, growing from adolescence to adulthood while learning to control Aiden and the powers they share. Willem Dafoe co-stars as Nathan Dawkins, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and Jodie's surrogate-father-figure. The actors in the game worked during the year-long project in Quantic Dream's Paris studio to perform on-set voice acting and motion capture acting. Despite being a video game, Beyond: Two Souls premiered at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, marking only the second time the film festival recognised a video game. David Cage, writer and director of the game, explained that game development studios should provide \"interactive storytelling\" that can be played by everyone, including non-gamers.

The game is the logical extension of Tetris into the third dimension. In regular Tetris, the player manipulates a set of tetrominoes which fall into a two-dimensional pit (seen from the side). The aim is to solve a real-time packing problem by forming complete rows, which then disappear and score points. Poor play leads to incomplete rows, caused by inefficient arrangements of tiles; these rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces. Similarly, in Blockout, the player manipulates a set of polycubes which fall into a three-dimensional pit (seen from above; the pieces appear in the foreground and fall away). The pieces can be rotated around all three axes, and moved horizontally and vertically. The aim is to form complete layers."@en ,

                       "Conflict is a hex-based NES war game where the player is a commander who must lead his forces to victory. The player can earn fame points by occupying cities and airports and destroying units of the opponent's army; fame points are lost by losing units of one's army in battle or retreating from battles. The goal of each of the 16 scenarios is to destroy the enemy's flag tank. The first player controls the blue (Western Bloc) forces while the computer (or second player) controls red (Eastern Bloc) troops. Each player starts with two or three factories, at least one of which specializes in air combat units and at least one of which specializes in ground warfare units. On each turn, the player can, if he still has a factory that has not been destroyed, produce one military unit. The more fame points the player has, the more powerful units he can produce (e.g. tanks instead of infantry). The computer always starts with more fame points than the human; since this state of affairs tends to produce an increasingly overwhelming materiel advantage if left unaddressed, the goal of depleting the computer's fame points, usually by destroying powerful red Army units, tends to be a high priority at the beginning of the game. The hexagons can be plains, woods, mountains, barren terrain, shoals, seas, bridges, airports, towns, or factories. The terrain in each hexagon has an effect on maneuverability and the extent to which forces can take evasive action. Units can be repaired, refueled, and rearmed at cities or airports, depending on whether the unit is a ground or air unit. A sequel was released for the Super NES entitled Super Conflict."@en ,

The game was developed and published by the Japanese company CyberStep, Inc. and has been officially released in several different countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and North America, with other areas like the EU, Germany and France preparing for official release. CosmicBreak is the sequel to another game by CyberStep, called C21 Steel Battle Chronicles, but contains more anime-styled characters, deeper developed story lines and offers thus more immersion.

It was released on December 25, 2002 for Japanese arcades, on October 9, 2003 for the Japanese PlayStation 2, and on September 21, 2004 for the North American PlayStation 2. This game is the ninth release in North America, but despite having the same name as its Japanese counterpart, its soundtrack is significantly different and won the Video Music Awards in 2005 on MTV for * Best Video Game Soundtrack. Despite its single-region arcade release, its popularity caused it to be exported or pirated and placed in game rooms worldwide. Examples of these bootleg titles are \"DDR MegaMix\" and \"DDR Extreme PLUS\". Dance Dance Revolution Extreme was the last game in the DDR Arcade franchise for 4 years until Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles. Konami issued an \"in-game\" thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced a rejuvenation of the entire series, but did not go into details. Konami's announcement led people to believe that DDR Extreme might be the last DDR release or that the series might be on hiatus or rebooted in the same manner as Beatmania and Beatmania IIDX. However, it continued to be released for video game consoles.

The game featured vastly superior graphics, utilizing the Sega Model 3 hardware. The majority of Daytona USA 2 cabinets were released as deluxe models (with far fewer Twin Cabinets), which could be linked together for up to four players. A notable change from the original is the ability to select a car and corresponding driver, each with varying capabilities for varying levels of player experience. Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps with a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km), an Advanced course with 4 laps with a distance of 2.5 miles (4 km), and a long Expert course with 2 laps with a distance of 5 miles (8 km). The 'time lap' mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an \"ending\" and see the game credits. An addition to the game was the \"slingshot\", corresponding to advanced NASCAR drafting techniques.There are no home ports of Battle on the Edge and Power Edition.

                       "Daytona USA is a racing video game developed by Sega AM2 and released by Sega, with a limited release in 1993 followed by a full release in 1994. One of the highest grossing arcade games of all time, Daytona USA was Sega's first title to debut on the Sega Model 2 arcade board, and, at the time of its release, was considered the most visually detailed 3D racing game. Compared to the flat-shaded polygons of its predecessor, Virtua Racing, Daytona's 3D-world was fully texture-mapped, giving it a more realistic appearance. Daytona was one of the first video games to feature filtered, texture-mapped polygons, giving it the most detailed graphics yet seen in a video game up until that time.

                       "Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition is a racing arcade game by Sega, specifically designed for the Sega Saturn. Released in 1996, it is a reworked and extended version of the original Daytona USA, and was developed by the same developer that oversaw the mostly arcade-perfect Saturn port of Sega Rally Championship, by using a modified version of the Sega Saturn engine of Sega Rally Championship. This version was originally released in Europe and North America (with some modifications done in the subsequent Japanese release), and drastically reduced the popup that was prevalent in the original Sega Saturn version of Daytona USA. With the increased framerate (now a solid thirty frames per second) came a new selection of cars, two new courses and a 2-player mode. Daytona USA: CCE is compatible with the Saturn's 3D analogue control pad, in addition to the Arcade Racer steering wheel and the Virtua Stick accessories. The European release is notable as the game did not feature the \"black bars\" at the top and bottom of the screen that are usually associated with the majority of PAL games of the era - the box even boasts \"slick new full screen graphics\". The game also sported a soundtrack by Richard Jacques and Jun Senoue which, while featuring remixes of the original tunes and several new ones, did not feature the original tunes themselves. It was also separately released for the Saturn as a Netlink-compatible title, entitled Daytona USA: CCE Netlink Edition. Although the accolade is commonly ascribed to Panzer Dragoon Saga, this NetLink version of Daytona USA: CCE is in fact the rarest North American Sega Saturn game. It was available only through Sega's online store, and making it even more rare is its almost total lack of distinguishability from the regular version of Daytona USA: CCE: the only notable differences are the additions of a black-and-white NetLink booklet with the standard booklet and a small NetLink logo on the game disc. This edition fetches up to US $1,900 (August 2013) on eBay, in the rare instances it does pop up. The game retained the \"Dancing Jeffry\" feature from the Seaside Street Galaxy from the original Daytona USA. Jeffry is actually one of the main characters from Virtua Fighter, but a statue of him was created in the course as a secondary feature. Just like the original Daytona USA, you have to press X while being in front of Jeffry to make him dance."@en ,

                       "Delta is a horizontally scrolling shooter computer game originally released for the Commodore 64 by Thalamus Ltd in 1987. It was programmed by Stavros Fasoulas and the music was written by Rob Hubbard. The menu-music is based on the theme of Koyaanisqatsi by Philip Glass and the in-game-music is based on Pink Floyd's On the Run. The game was also released for the ZX Spectrum in 1990 as Delta Charge. The game was released as Delta Patrol in the United States by Electronic Arts for its Amazing Software line of action-oriented software programs, in 1987 on the Commodore 64. The player controls a spaceship and gains power-up points by destroying formations of enemies. Some enemy formations instead subtract power-up points for the player, so the player must take note of which formations to destroy. Periodically blocks containing the power-ups (higher speed, faster rate of fire) appear and the player can pick one of them up: The more points the player has collected, the more powerful are the power-ups that can be chosen. Unavailable power-ups are gray and kill the player if he flies into them, making them part of the obstacles in the game. The effects of the power-ups are lost over time and must therefore be regained. The player gets a choice between in-game music or in-game sound effects. There is also a high score table but no way to save it when the game is turned off. The game title music was covered by Desert Planet in their 2003 album Joystick Pop."@en ,

Concepts for an MMORPG within the Dragon Quest series began among a small team during the later development of Dragon Quest VIII. Development progressed alongside that of Dragon Quest IX. The aim was to make it accessible to series fans and newcomers alike, along with creating a long-term content plan. The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama.

                       "Dying Light is an open world first person action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Polish video game developer Techland and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Announced in May 2013, it was released in January 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game was once planned to be released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but was later cancelled due to hardware limitations. The game revolves around an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who is sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone in a city called Harran. It features an enemy-infested, open-world city with a dynamic day and night cycle. The day-night cycle changes the game drastically, as enemies become more aggressive and more difficult to deal with during night time. The gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and parkour. The game also features an asymmetrical multiplayer mode (originally set to be a pre-order bonus); and a four-player, co-operative multiplayer mode. The development of the game began in early 2012. Prior to the game's official announcement, several reports claimed that Dying Light was a sequel to Dead Island, another franchise created by Techland. The rumor was later denied. The game's parkour system puts emphasis on natural movement. To implement that, Techland had to abandon most of the story elements, and had to build them again from scratch. The music development was handled by Paweł Błaszczak. According to him, the soundtrack was inspired by movie soundtracks of the '70s and '80s. At release, Dying Light received positive reviews from critics, with praise mainly directed at the combat, graphics, co-operative multiplayer, navigation and the day-night cycle, while receiving criticism regarding the story, difficulty and technical issues. The game was the best-selling title for the month of January 2015 and broke the record for the first month sales for a new survival horror intellectual property. Techland announced that they would be committed to the game after its release. As a result, in May 2015, they put another project on hold to concentrate on the post-release development of Dying Light. The team released numerous updates, and two downloadable content packages, namely Cuisine & Cargo and The Bozak Horde. An expansion, titled Dying Light: The Following was announced as well and was released on February 9, 2016."@en ,

Eat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a \"legendary\" gaming hero who is \"returning to glory\" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game.

                       "Emerald City Confidential is a 2009 computer adventure game conceived by Dave Gilbert, developed by Wadjet Eye Games and published through PlayFirst. It follows the protagonist Petra, Emerald City's only private eye, as she is approached by a strange woman named Dee Gale. Dee's fiancé is missing, and she is willing to pay Petra above the going rate in order to find him. Lacking any other prospects, Petra agrees. What starts off as a simple missing person case soon takes Petra deep into the seedy underbelly of the Emerald City's criminal underground and beyond. She encounters many characters from the Oz canon and some new characters, learns several magic spells, and uncovers the answer to a dark secret that has haunted Petra all her life. Emerald City Confidential is a third-person, mouse-driven, adventure game in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the linear storyline to proceed. As a pure graphical adventure game, Emerald City Confidential follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts: it is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to fully immerse him/herself in Emerald City Confidential's universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need to save the game. With this in mind, there are no save game functions, but the player's position is automatically bookmarked and restored when the game is restarted. The game is set in the magical land of Oz, created by L. Frank Baum, as put through the gritty filter of 1940s film noir, with harsh city streets, grey rainy skies, femmes fatales, tough guys, trenchcoats, fedoras and plot twists. It's Oz, seen through the eyes of Raymond Chandler."@en ,

The game focuses on Mickey Mouse, who accidentally damages a world created by Yen Sid for forgotten characters and concepts, and is forced to fix the world while combating antagonists with a magic paintbrush. Epic Mickey notably features the first appearance of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit since 1943 as a major character, who was one of Walt Disney's first successful cartoon characters before the character was licensed under the ownership of Universal Studios. The character was regained by The Walt Disney Company in 2006 under the guidance of Bob Iger. The game also marks the first time that Oswald and Mickey ever appeared together. The game is much darker and more complex than previous Mickey Mouse games.

Published by Square in 1991 on the original Game Boy, it later saw a North American re-release by Sunsoft in April 1998. Originally being developed under the name Gemma Knights, features gameplay roughly similar to that of the original The Legend of Zelda game, but with the addition of role-playing video game statistical elements. Along with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, Final Fantasy Adventure was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe. A remake, Sword of Mana, was released in 2003 changing the plot and many gameplay aspects. A second remake was released on mobile phones in Japan which only improved the graphics and music of the original version. A third remake, Adventures of Mana, was released for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita on February 4, 2016. The story follows the hero and the young heroine as they attempt to thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant, Julius, from destroying the Tree of Mana and dooming their world. The game was released with many familiar elements of the Final Fantasy series, such as Chocobos, but these were later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the Mana series. Final Fantasy Adventure was met with generally positive reviews at the time of its release. Over the course of time, reviewers have considered it one of the best action adventure games on the Game Boy. The game also spawned an entirely new game series, called the Mana series, which became a successful video game RPG franchise."@en ,

Several bonus features were added to each game, such as art galleries, bestiaries, and cutscenes—including computer-generated full motion video used at the beginning of Final Fantasy IV and anime scenes used throughout Chrono Trigger. Final Fantasy Chronicles was received well by players and critics, who praised the peripheral features and the fact that Square was offering RPG classics to a new generation of gamers. Conversely, reviewers sharply criticized \"long and frequent loading\" between areas and battles due to poor emulation.

Originally released in 2000, it is the ninth title in the Final Fantasy series and last to debut on the original PlayStation console. In 2010, it was re-released as a PSone Classics title on the PlayStation Network. The game introduced new features to the series like the \"Active Time Event\", \"Mognet\", and a unique equipment and skill system. Final Fantasy IX's plot centers on a war between nations. Players follow a young thief named Zidane Tribal, who joins with others to defeat Queen Brahne of Alexandria, the one responsible for starting the war. The plot shifts, however, when the characters realise that Brahne is working with an even more threatening person called Kuja. Final Fantasy IX was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII, but took a different approach by returning to the more traditional style of the early Final Fantasy games. Consequently, Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to other titles in the series. It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling 5.30 million units worldwide by March 31, 2003.

The game was released as a spin-off to Square's popular Final Fantasy series of video games. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first released in North America in 1992 and marketed as a \"simplified role-playing game...designed for the entry-level player\" in an attempt to broaden the genre's appeal. The game's presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but it differed in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe. In the game, the player controls a youth named Benjamin in his quest to save the world. His goal is to reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine the state of the world's four elemental powers. The gameplay takes a departure from the main series in a variety of ways. Many series staples are eliminated, such as random battles, save points, manual equipment, and the party system. The game received middling reviews and sales in North America and Japan, citing its simplified gameplay and lack of depth in the game's story. Over time, the game has kept the reputation for being a \"beginner's Final Fantasy\" and has been praised for its music."@en ,
                       "Final Fantasy VII is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the PlayStation platform. It was directed by Yoshinori Kitase, written by Kazushige Nojima and Kitase, and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi. The music was composed by Final Fantasy veteran Nobuo Uematsu, while the series' long-time character designer, Yoshitaka Amano, was replaced by Tetsuya Nomura. Released in 1997, it is the seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series and the first in the series to use 3D computer graphics, featuring fully rendered characters on pre-rendered backgrounds. It was also the first game in the main series to be released in Europe. The story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins the eco-terrorist rebel organization AVALANCHE to stop the world-controlling megacorporation Shinra from draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Cloud and his allies become involved in a larger world-threatening conflict and face off against Sephiroth, the main antagonist. Development of Final Fantasy VII began in 1994. It was originally developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but was moved to the Nintendo 64; since the Nintendo 64's cartridges lacked the required storage capacity for substantial prerendered movie footage, Square moved the game to the CD-ROM based PlayStation. Helped by a large pre-release promotional campaign, Final Fantasy VII was a critical and commercial success. It was released in 1997 for the Sony PlayStation, in 1998 for Windows, in 2009 on the PlayStation Network, in 2012 on PC Digital Download, and in 2013 on Steam. In 2014, the game was released for Android and iPhone devices through the Japan-only streaming service \"Dive In\". On December 6, 2014, it was announced that Final Fantasy VII would be released on the PlayStation 4, with upscaled graphics. It has continued to sell solidly, with more than 11 million copies sold by 2015, making it the best-selling title in the series. Final Fantasy VII has been praised for its graphics, gameplay, music and story. Criticism has primarily pertained to its English localization. The iOS version of Final Fantasy VII was released on August 19, 2015, adding touch controls, an auto-save feature and the ability to disable random encounters. This was followed by the PlayStation 4 port with high speed mode finally releasing in December 2015 and on Android in July 2016. The game is acknowledged for having boosted the sales of PlayStation consoles and popularizing Japanese role-playing video games outside Japan. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest games of all time. The game's popularity has led to a series of prequels and sequels under the collective title Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Square Enix announced a high-definition remake of the game at E3 2015 for the PlayStation 4."@en ,
                       "Final Fantasy XIV (ファイナルファンタジーXIV Fainaru Fantajī Fōtīn), also known as Final Fantasy XIV Online, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for Microsoft Windows personal computers, developed and published by Square Enix in 2010. It is the fourteenth entry in the main Final Fantasy series and the second MMORPG in the series after Final Fantasy XI. Set in the fantasy realm of Eorzea, players take control of a customized avatar as they explore the land and are caught up in both an invasion by the hostile Garlean Empire and the threat of the Primals, the deities of the land's Beastmen tribes. Eventually, they are embroiled in a plot by a Garlean Legatus to destroy the Primals by bringing one of the planet's moons down on Eorzea. The game had been in development since 2005 under the codename \"Rapture\", and was announced in 2009 for Windows and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. It ran on Square Enix's Crystal Tools middleware engine, which was adjusted to suit the game's specifications. During development, the team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from XI while creating something that stood on its own. Due to several factors, the development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on the game. Attempts to bring the game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with Microsoft about the use of Xbox Live. After its alpha test and a delayed beta test, the game went live on September 30, 2010, remaining active until its servers were closed on November 11, 2012. At launch, the game received a mixed to negative reaction: while the graphics and music met with general praise, other aspects were unanimously panned, including the gameplay, interface, and the general impression of the game being unfinished at launch. Critic and fan backlash caused Square Enix to pull subscription fees, indefinitely postpone the PlayStation 3 version, and eventually develop an entirely new version of the game called Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn."@en ,

It is the fourteenth game in the Fire Emblem series, and the second to be developed for Nintendo 3DS after Fire Emblem Awakening. Fates was released in three versions, each following a different storyline centered around the same characters: Birthright and Conquest as physical releases, and Revelation as downloadable content. The overarching story follows the protagonist, a customizable Avatar created by the player, as they are unwillingly drawn into a war between the Kingdoms of Hoshido (their birthplace) and Nohr (their adopted home), and must choose which side to support. In Revelation, the Avatar rallies both sides against the true mastermind behind the war. The gameplay, which focuses around tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield, shares many mechanics with previous Fire Emblem games, although some elements are unique to each scenario. After the critical and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, with the staff of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show all sides of the story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases. It also met with commercial success surpassing that of Awakening."@en ,

The drivers on the front cover, from left to right are: Jean Alesi, Michael Schumacher and Mika Häkkinen. Other innovations included the pit lane speed limiter and a clutch. This game was a considerable and welcome improvement upon Formula 1 98. It may have lacked an \"arcade\" mode or that extra polish, but Studio 33 clearly concentrated on the most important aspects of the simulation mode, leaving the addition of an arcade mode for Formula One 2000. The AI was suspect, and often cheated the player when pulling out a substantial gap, the AI would then do impossible lap times to catch up and pass. This was also inherent in the Newmann Haas Game which Studio 33 also developed. Another AI tactic was to simply pass through solid walls when trying to overtake the player. This was especially noticeable in Monaco. Like usual, this game features in game commentary provided by Murray Walker and Martin Brundle. It was also the first F1 game to feature Jacques Villeneuve after he had prevented the use of his image and name for the 1997 and 1998 editions. During the making of this game, Psygnosis was taken over by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and became SCE Studio Liverpool.

                       "Formula One Championship Edition is a racing video game, developed by SCE Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. The game follows the basic structure of Formula One 06 for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The main differences include the updated visuals for the PS3 including a lot more detail, Sixaxis compatibility, real time reflections, car reflections on wet circuits and new wet weather effects. It was announced early in development that the safety car would be included in the game for the first time in an F1 game since Formula One 99 for the PlayStation. However, it was removed before the final release along with the PSP wing mirror integration shown at E3. The game also boasts dynamic weather, and improved AI. The AI system is called \"Live Action Racing\" where one can pressure the opposition, causing them to make little mistakes such as running wide on corners, causing them to crash into other cars or spin off the road of their own accord. The AI will then try to seek opportunities to pass the player in a realistic manner. The game is based on the early F1 season. Hence, Yuji Ide drives for Super Aguri when in reality he lost his super licence just 4 races into the '06 season, and Franck Montagny, then later Sakon Yamamoto took his seat. Other minor changes throughout the real 2006 season are also not represented. In the career mode, players begin by running tests for one of three teams (Toro Rosso, Super Aguri or Midland F1) at either the Silverstone, Magny Cours or Catalunya circuits. The tests given vary between the teams. When the player successfully completes the tests, they are given the role of test driver or race driver, depending on how well the player performed in the test. After performing well as a test driver, the player will become the second driver of the team. From there the player can compete in race weekends through many different roles. As a test driver the player will try out different car settings in practice, and as a driver the player will have track position targets to meet to keep the seat. The player's performances are subject to review at several points during the season. The initial release did not include force-feedback support, which is considered by many to be an important feature for simulation racing games used with driving wheel controllers. A subsequent update in early 2008 added force feedback. The game also lacks support for 1080i or 1080p output resolutions. Per the calendar, the Belgian Grand Prix is not included.

It was one of the first racing games to feature a career mode, multiple vehicles and an opportunity for the player to increase the performance of their in-game car through car tuning, which were unique elements for a racer of the NES era and a genre only truly revisited during the fifth generation of game consoles where games such as Gran Turismo became popular.

With gameplay similar to Rad Racer and Pole Position, the driver races towards the back of the screen. The names of the opponents are chosen partially at random; they can also vary because of the ranking level of the course and the type of vehicle used. Like in Rad Racer, the player can supercharge an automobile to go up to 255 miles per hour or 410 kilometres per hour."@en ,

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online. Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available.

Lightning, the main protagonist of the first game and a key character in the second, awakes from a self-imposed hibernation 13 days before the world's end, and is chosen by the deity Bhunivelze to save the people of the dying world, including former friends and allies who have developed heavy emotional burdens. As she travels, she learns the full truth behind both the world's fate and Bhunivelze's true agenda. Development of the game started in May 2012, shortly after the release of XIII-2's final piece of DLC, and was unveiled at a special 25th Anniversary Event for the Final Fantasy series in September that year. Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end to the story of both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms leveled against the last two games. During its first week on sale in Japan, it sold 277,000 units, and by the end of 2013 become the 17th best-selling game of the year selling over 400,000 copies. It has sold 800,000 copies as of May 2014. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. The Windows PC version has sold over 200,000 copies according to SteamSpy. It has received mixed reviews: while the main praise went to the game's battle system, opinions were more mixed for the graphics, time limit and other aspects of gameplay, while the story and characters were criticized for being weak or poorly developed."@en ,

                       "MIDI Maze is an early first person shooter maze video game for the Atari ST developed by Xanth Software F/X, published by Hybrid Arts, and released around 1987. It owes a significant debt to what may be the first of its genre, Maze War. The original MIDI Maze team consisted of James Yee as the business manager, Michael Park as the graphics and distributed processing guru, and George Miller writing the AI/drone logic. The game constructed multiplayer networks using the MIDI interface. It has been suggested that MIDI Maze introduced the concept of deathmatch combat. Up to 16 computers could be networked in a \"MIDI Ring\" by connecting one computer's MIDI-OUT port to the next computer's MIDI-IN port. Unless the computers were looped correctly, more than 4 players tended to slow down the game to a crawl and make it unstable. Graphically the game was very simple with a humorous twist. The game area itself occupied only roughly a quarter of the screen and consisted of a first-person view of a flat-shaded Pac-Man-like maze with a crosshair in the middle. All players were shown as Pac-Man-like smiley avatars in various colors. Bullets were represented as small balls. The game was started by one designated \"master\" machine, which set rules, divided players into teams, and selected a maze. A number of mazes were supplied with the game, and additional mazes could be constructed using a simple text-editor or one of various third-party tools. The game was very popular at gatherings of Atari ST users until the end of the Atari ST era, circa 1993. A prototype of MIDI Maze was found for the Atari 8-bit family. It is possible to connect ST and 8-bit to a network and play together. A three-day all-day MIDI Maze tournament is one popular attraction at Con of the North, a gaming convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota."@en ,

It is a sharply detailed dungeon crawler similar to many other role-playing video games and adventure games. The game distinguished itself from other games of its time by including a multiplayer mode that functioned over the AppleTalk protocol or Point-to-Point Protocol.

The game's tagline was \"Kill your enemies. Kill your friends' enemies. Kill your friends.\" This tagline has reappeared as a description in the multiplayer menu screens for some of Bungie's other games, such as Myth: The Fallen Lords and Halo 3. Bungie later licensed Minotaur's game engine to the studio Paranoid Productions (Richard Rouse) who used it to create the single-player CRPG Odyssey: The Legend of Nemesis, released in 1996."@en ,

The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems in April 2011, and a PlayStation Vita port was released in May 2012. An expanded version of the game, titled Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition, was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in February 2012 and for Microsoft Windows in July 2013. Although beginning during the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, the plot is a retcon to the earliest period in the Mortal Kombat series, the trilogy of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3. The storyline involves the divine protector of Earth, Raiden, attempting to change the aftermath of the events of Armageddon by contacting his past self as he faces defeat at the hands of the evil emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn. While having characters and levels rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances itself from the fully 3D graphics one seen in the last four games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field. Upon release, Mortal Kombat received very positive reviews and won several awards for fighting game of the year. It was also a commercial success, selling more than two million copies in the first month alone. Due to its extremely violent content, the game was banned in Australia due to the lack of appropriate ratings category, and South Korea, and it has been reportedly indexed in Germany; the Australian ban was later lifted due to the introduction of an R18 classification and the game was released with many other R rated games in May 2014.

It is based on a modified version of their Temple of Apshai game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family. The game requires the player to search out a space fortress looking for ten hostages. Presented in a top-down view, the player can only see the area immediately around them, so the entire base has to be searched room by room. There is a 60 minute time limit on the mission. Rescue at Rigel was soon followed by Star Warrior, and the two rebranded to be part of their \"Starquest\" series, although Star Warrior used a more heavily modified game engine than Rigel."@en ,
                       "Resident Evil 6 (Japanese: バイオハザード6 Hepburn: Baiohazādo Shikkusu) is an action-adventure third-person shooter video game developed and published by Capcom. The ninth main installment of the Resident Evil series, it was first released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 2 October 2012, and for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 2013. It was re-released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with all downloadable content on 29 March 2016. The story is told from the perspectives of Chris Redfield, a former member and founder of the Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) traumatized by a failed operation; Leon S. Kennedy, a Raccoon City survivor and agent for the US government; Jake Muller, an illegitimate son of Albert Wesker and associate of Sherry Birkin; and Ada Wong, a freelance agent framed for the bio-terrorist attacks by the antagonistic corporation Neo-Umbrella. They must all confront the force behind a massive bio-terrorist attack with the newly developed C-virus in cities across the world. Gameplay is centered around their four interwoven storylines, in which each player-character has unique abilities and styles. The game was first conceptualised in 2009, with full development commencing the following year under Resident Evil 4 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi. Resident Evil 6 had a development staff of more than 600, making it Capcom's largest production to date. The developers define the game's genre as \"dramatic horror\", although promotional materials for the Japanese version still classify the game as survival horror. The game received mixed reviews from critics upon release; some reviewers praised the game's storyline and themes, however the four interwoven campaigns were criticised, as well as the game's departure from the survival horror genre. Despite the criticisms, it was a financial success; with over 6 million copies sold, it currently stands as Capcom's second best-selling game. A sequel, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, is set to be released in January 2017."@en ,
                       "Resident Evil, known in Japan as biohazard, is a survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom and originally released for the GameCube video game console in 2002. It is a remake of the 1996 game Resident Evil, the first installment in the Resident Evil video game series. The story takes place in 1998 near the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City where a series of bizarre murders have taken place. The player takes on the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, S.T.A.R.S. agents sent in by the city to investigate the murders. Resident Evil was developed over the course of one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring the game closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics were vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game. Upon release, Resident Evil received critical acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its graphics and improved gameplay over the original game. It is often described as one of the best, scariest, and most visually impressive entries in the Resident Evil series. Despite this, the game sold worse than expected and led Capcom to change the direction of the series to a more action-oriented approach. In 2008, the game was ported to the Wii, featuring a new control system. A high-definition version of the game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in 2015 to positive critical reception and commercial success."@en ,

It was originally published in English by Got Game Entertainment and Lighthouse Interactive. However, following the financial collapse of Lighthouse Interactive early in 2009, all European rights reverted to Arberth Studios. The developer then converted itself into a publisher and began selling the English game directly. In May 2009, Arberth dispensed with the services of Got Game Entertainment following months of declining stock availability in Got Game's North American Territory and a failure of Got Game to pay expected royalties. In August 2010, Arberth was still pursuing Got Game Entertainment for unpaid royalties. Arberth has since released a German version of the game. A Russian version appeared in 2009, translated and distributed by Logrus. In mid-2009, a group of French and Belgian enthusiasts known as Les Rhemystes completed the French translation and a download-only release followed in the Autumn, again published by Arberth Studios. Italian gaming site Puntaeclicca.com enabled the Italian download-only release in 2010.

An ancient battle for revenge engulfs Ty Pryderi, the remote Welsh farmstead Rhiannon now calls home. She begins to hear unexplained noises, see disturbing visions, and experience other chilling paranormal phenomena.

Her parents take Rhiannon away, leaving Ty Pryderi to your watch and exploration, but their absence can only postpone the inevitability of revenge and death.

Rust was originally released onto Steam's Early Access program on 11 December 2013. Rust was initially created as a clone of DayZ, a popular mod for ARMA 2 with the addition of crafting elements. The game tasks players to survive in the wilderness by crafting items using the materials they gather or steal; the player starts with only a rock and a torch. There is only a multiplayer mode and a prevalent concept in Rust is to form and join clans with other players. Raiding is a very common action, usually done in large clans. Since Rust's first alpha launch, animals, hunting and the ability to craft armor and weapons have been added. It initially featured zombies as enemies, but subsequently replaced them with bears and wolves. Radiation was also removed due to the frustration it was causing players. Throughout Rust's alpha release, it was met with mixed critic reviews and many comparisons with other survival games were made, with the most common one being the mixture between DayZ and Minecraft. Reviewers praised the game's concept and gameplay, while also noting the obvious unfinishedness. By the end of 2015, Rust had sold over three million copies."@en ,

The game was released on September 15, 2009 in North America, September 30, 2009 in Australia, October 9, 2009 in Europe and on January 27, 2011 in Japan as Flash Puzzle: Maxwell's Mysterious Notebook (ヒラメキパズル マックスウェルの不思議なノート Hirameki Pazuru: Makkusuweru no Fushigi na Nōto) by Konami. It is the third Nintendo DS video game made by 5th Cell, the first two being Drawn to Life and Lock's Quest. The objective of Scribblenauts, as implied by its catchphrase \"Write Anything, Solve Everything\", is to complete puzzles to collect \"Starites\", helped by the player's ability to summon any object (from a database of tens of thousands) by writing its name on the touchscreen. The game is considered by its developers to help promote emergent gameplay by challenging the player to solve its puzzles within certain limitations or through multiple solutions. Jeremiah Slaczka, creator and director of Scribblenauts, envisioned the game as a combination of solving life situation puzzles alongside Mad Libs. His vision was brought to realization through the \"Objectnaut\" engine created by 5th Cell's technical director, Marius Fahlbusch. Objectnaut allowed for a data driven approach, and a significant portion of the development time was spent researching nouns and their properties, and categorizing them into the Objectnaut database. This, along with the simple art designs of 5th Cell's Edison Yan, allowed for the team to easily add new words to the database without expending much effort to program new behavior. Scribblenauts was first shown in a playable form at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo, and became a sleeper hit, winning several \"Best of Show\" awards, being the first portable console game to win such praise. Reviewers believed that 5th Cell delivered on their promise to allow nearly any possible object to be created for use in Scribblenauts, but also lamented that the choice of controls in the game hampered their full enjoyment of the title. The success of the title has led to a number of sequels including Super Scribblenauts, Scribblenauts Remix, and Scribblenauts Unlimited. The series has sold over 13 million copies."@en ,

                       "Shadowbane was a free fantasy role-playing video game (MMORPG) created by Wolfpack Studios and published on March 25, 2003 by Ubisoft for Windows and Mac platforms. Originally commercial and subscription-driven, Shadowbane was launched in March 2003, and was the creation of text-MUD veterans J. Todd Coleman, James Nance, Josef Hall, Patrick Blanton and Robert Marsa and a team of 45 programmers, designers and artists. It closed on July 1, 2009. Shadowbane was a top-10 best selling PC game at launch, and had two noteworthy aspects. First, the majority of the game world allowed for open player versus player combat, making it an early pioneer title in the PvP MMO genre. Second, it was the first major MMO to offer dynamic world content as a primary feature of the game. Most MMOs are static, meaning the world itself does not change based on player actions. Dynamic worlds allow player to change the game world itself; morphing terrain, building and destroying buildings and fortifications, and setting up patrol paths for player-hired AI combatants. The game was considered a \"cult hit\" and sustained a small base of followers, but technical issues plagued the game at launch and failed to retain much of the early fanbase shortly afterward. After the sale of Wolfpack Studios to Ubi Soft in March 2004, the live service was transitioned to a new management and (largely new) development team, led by Frank Lucero and Ala Diaz. This team later splintered off to become Stray Bullet Games in June 2006, and Mark Nuasha was brought in to run the organization. On March 15, 2006 the game was made free-to-play. A system of short ads was introduced on March 6, 2007 to fund operating costs, which are displayed when the game is opened or closed and when a character dies (with at least 10 minutes between death ads). On March 19, 2008, all servers were closed to prepare for the \"Shadowbane Reboot,\" a relaunching of the game to capitalize on stability and performance gains hindered by previously existing data. All player characters and cities were deleted in this reboot. On March 25, 2008, the fifth anniversary of the game's launch, two servers were brought online followed by a third due to overpopulation. The game was closed the following July. The regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world will sometimes depend on the servers, many of which have unique world maps). Gameplay features many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races.

                       "Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey (Japanese: 真・女神転生 STRANGE JOURNEY) is a role-playing video game developed by Atlus and Lancarse for the Nintendo DS. It was published by Atlus in 2009 in Japan, and in 2010 in North America. It is the fourth entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series, which forms the core of the Megami Tensei franchise. The story follows a special task force sent by the United Nations to investigate the Schwarzwelt, a spatial distortion that appears in Antarctica and threatens to engulf the world. Players take control of an unnamed protagonist, navigating the environments of the Schwarzwelt in first-person. Combat involves the player and recruited demons fighting against various enemies, with the protagonist having the option of talking with and recruiting enemies. The game originated from the team's wish to develop a large-scale role-playing game for the DS. Many of the main staff had worked on previous Megami Tensei titles in some capacity, including producer and designer Kazuma Kaneko, director Eiji Ishida, writer Shogo Isogai, and composer Shoji Meguro. The setting in Antarctica was chosen to appeal to an overseas audience. Alongside the new setting, the game featured multiple science fiction elements new to the series, taking inspiration from films such as Damnation Alley and The Thing. For the music, Meguro used grander musical styles than his previous works, incorporating choir music using a special synthesizer. Reception of the game has been generally positive for its story and gameplay, but many disliked its first-person navigation."@en ,

                       "Silent Hill 3 is a survival horror video game published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and developed by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. It is the third installment in the Silent Hill series and a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game. It was released in May 2003, with a port to Microsoft Windows released in October of the same year. A remastered high-definition version titled Silent Hill HD Collection was released for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 20, 2012.

She discovers that the cult plans to use her to birth their god, and becomes caught in a conflict within the cult. Silent Hill 3 was mostly well received by critics, especially in its presentation, including the environments, graphics and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes that are continued from past installments.

                       "Silent Hill: Shattered Memories (サイレントヒル　シャッタードメモリーズ Sairento Hiru: Shattādo Memorīzu) is a survival horror video game developed by Climax Studios and published by Konami Digital Entertainment for the Wii in December 2009. It was ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable platforms, and these versions were released in January 2010. In April 2014, it appeared on the PlayStation Network in Europe. The game serves as a reimagining of the first installment. Shattered Memories retains the premise of the original game—Harry Mason's quest to find his missing daughter in the fictitious American town of Silent Hill—but is set in a different fictional universe, has a different plot, and altered characters, alongside new ones. Five endings are available. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to an alternate dimension. Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey. After designing the Silent Hill prequel (2007), which intentionally replicated elements of the first installment, Climax Studios wanted to try a different approach to creating a title in the series. Among the changes made was the removal of combat and the constant presence of monsters. Akira Yamaoka composed the soundtrack of the game, which was the first in the series to prominently feature dynamic music. The game received generally positive reviews, and its graphics, storyline, voice acting, soundtrack, and use of the Wii Remote were praised by reviewers. Some reviewers criticized Shattered Memories' chase sequences and duration, which they deemed potentially frustrating and short."@en ,

The original Shockwave version launched in 2000 but went offline in early 2009. A successful Kickstarter campaign was launched in early 2013 by some members of the original development team, who announced the re-release of the game as open source in HTML5. The original date for the game's relaunch was September 2013, but was delayed. An open beta test, started on 30 July 2014, is currently underway. The gameplay is simple on its surface, but requires solid strategy to win consistently. The graphics are also simple, and were inspired by the work of \"outsider artist\" Henry Darger, illustrator Edward Gorey, Japanese anime, and early, 8-bit video games of the 1980s. The game, which was inspired in part by Lucasfilm's pioneering online role-playing game, Habitat, was designed to ignite community-building through chat both in the game and on its associate message boards. In a departure from the androcentric norm in video games, all of the players in Sissyfight were rendered female and nonsexual. Sissyfight is often cited as an early example of a web-based MMOG in gaming development and academic circles. Although each game session only contained three to six players at a time, the mechanics of \"brownie points\" and the robust community surrounding Sissyfight created a much more \"massive\" experience than most small-scale web games."@en ,

                       "System Shock is a 1994 first-person action role-playing video game developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published by Origin Systems. It was directed by Doug Church with Warren Spector serving as producer. The game is set aboard a space station in a cyberpunk vision of the year 2072. Assuming the role of a nameless hacker, the player attempts to hinder the plans of a malevolent artificial intelligence called SHODAN. System Shock's 3D engine, physics simulation and complex gameplay have been cited as both innovative and influential. The developers sought to build on the emergent gameplay and immersive environments of their previous games, Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds, by streamlining their mechanics into a more \"integrated whole\". Critics praised System Shock and hailed it as a major breakthrough in its genre. It was later placed on multiple hall of fame lists. The game was a moderate commercial success, with sales exceeding 170,000 copies, but Looking Glass ultimately lost money on the project. A sequel, System Shock 2, was released by Looking Glass Studios and offshoot developer Irrational Games in 1999 and a third game is currently in development by Otherside Studios. The 2000 game Deus Ex and the 2007 game BioShock are spiritual successors to the two games. A remade version of the original game by Night Dive Studios is scheduled for release in 2017."@en ,

                       "Tearaway Unfolded is a 2015 platform-adventure video game developed by Tarsier Studios and Media Molecule, while being published by Sony Computer Entertainment, exclusively for the PlayStation 4. Originally announced at Gamescom 2014, the game is an expanded remake of the 2013 PlayStation Vita game Tearaway, which was also developed by Media Molecule. Tearaway Unfolded, like the Vita original, takes place in a vibrant storybook-type world made almost entirely out of paper. The player gains control of one of Iota or Atoi, a Messenger tasked with delivering a letter to a portal in the sky called 'the You', which has mysteriously been opened. However, the messenger must also save the world from Scraps, small villainous creatures which are invading the paper world via the opening to cause disruption. Tearaway Unfolded's gameplay revolves around environmental platform interaction, creativity and customizability, confrontations with Scraps and other antagonistical creatures, mini-quests issued by non-playable characters, and finding collectibles. The player, who controls several aspects of the world in a god-like fashion, navigates the messenger through the environments by changing the landscape. For example, in order to help Iota/Atoi advance through a specific section, the player may have to trigger bounce pads, rotate platforms, illuminate objects, cast gusts of wind, or hurl objects, to trigger the solution and allow progression. The player is tasked with designing objects for use in the game's world, which are mostly used to solve people's problems or requests, but may also be used for decorative purposes. The messenger is given several helpful tools over the course of the game, which introduce new gameplay mechanics, and, among other things, allow for alternate methods of traversal. Tearaway Unfolded was met with a positive critical reception upon release. Critics mostly praised the game's controls, visuals, characters, and world design. Some critics disliked the emphasis on optional controllers, while others felt that the original PlayStation Vita version was a more personal experience, and therefore, better overall. Despite the positive reviews, the game was considered a commercial disappointment."@en ,

It was originally released as an expansion set for Microsoft Windows and is included within the Morrowind: Game of the Year edition for Xbox. Unlike the first expansion Tribunal, which added a city separate from the world map consisting of interior cells, Bloodmoon adds a large new island to the original world map, a cold northern territory named Solstheim. Rather than the Dunmer (dark elves) that are the indigenous race in the nearby Vvardenfell, Solstheim is populated largely by the Nord race. This is largely because the island sits more or less astride the border between Morrowind and the Nord homeland of Skyrim. This expansion adds new enemies, the East Empire Company as a joinable guild, and the possibility to become a werewolf, akin to the inclusion of vampires seen in Morrowind. Bloodmoon also uses larger and more detailed environments, including snowfall, thus raising the computer hardware requirements, though the ash storms of the original game are much more graphically demanding than the snow of Bloodmoon. As with Morrowind and Tribunal, Bloodmoon has many side-quests to finish and many caves to explore aside from its main quest. Unlike Tribunal, which is intended to be played after the completion of Morrowind's main quest, Bloodmoon's main-quest is self-contained within the expansion."@en ,

The gameplay in SP features changes from its predecessor, including an additional promise system which puts more of a focus on communication.

The story is told from the perspective of a producer in charge of training 10 prospective pop idols on their way to stardom, and each version of SP features different idols. One reason for dividing SP among three versions when developing the games was to allow players to buy the version which features their favorite idols. Rival idols were introduced into SP because the development team felt that rivals are essential for The Idolmaster, which also serve to deepen the bonds between the player and an idol. Including downloadable content, the game features 54 songs the idols perform: 34 songs in original versions and 20 remixes of those songs, which have been released on several music albums. The three versions of SP sold 129,088 units collectively in their first week of sales, and together ranked as the second best-selling video games in Japan that week."@en ,

The game was released in Japanese arcades in 1999 and was ported to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit. A Windows version was released in 2000 and a PlayStation 2 port followed in 2004.

The PC version of The Typing of the Dead sold 120,000 units in 2003. A Sony PlayStation 2 port was called The Typing of the Dead: Zombie Panic. This version was released exclusively in Japan in late December 2004 and was packaged with a USB keyboard. The game was mostly unchanged, although the Dreamcast backpacks were replaced with PS2 backpacks and new minigames were incorporated into the main story.

Though originally slated for release in the fall of 2004, it was delayed until the following spring when it came out for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Microsoft Windows. Handheld versions for the Nintendo DS, Mobile phone and N-Gage were also released. A Game Boy Advance port was planned, but later cancelled. Chaos Theory is the third game in the Splinter Cell series endorsed by novelist Tom Clancy. As with previous entries in the franchise, Chaos Theory follows the activities of Sam Fisher, an agent working for a covert-ops branch within the NSA called \"Third Echelon\". The game has a significantly darker tone than its predecessors, featuring more combat and the option for Fisher to kill people he interrogates as opposed to simply knocking them out. As a result, it was the first Splinter Cell game to receive an M-rating by the ESRB, an assessment which has since been applied to all subsequent releases in the series. Actor Michael Ironside reprised his role as Fisher, while Don Jordan returned from the original game to voice Third Echelon director Irving Lambert, having been replaced by Dennis Haysbert in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. Chaos Theory was an instant commercial success, selling 2.5 million units across all platforms within a month of its release. The Xbox and PC versions of the game received near-universal acclaim from critics and fans alike; the GameCube and PlayStation 2 iterations were also released to generally positive reviews. Official Xbox Magazine named it the Xbox \"Game of the Year\" (2005) for its strong gameplay and lifelike graphics. A remastered HD edition was bundled with the first two games of the series as part of the Splinter Cell Trilogy for the PlayStation 3, released on December 20, 2010.

The player controls a Native American warrior, Turok, who must stop the evil Campaigner from conquering the universe with an ancient and powerful weapon. As Acclaim's first exclusive title for the Nintendo 64, Turok was part of a strategy to develop games internally and license merchandise; Acclaim acquired the rights to Turok when it purchased Acclaim Comics (né Valiant) in 1994. Suffering from cash flow problems and falling sales, Acclaim came to rely on Turok as its best hope for a financial turnaround. Iguana pushed the Nintendo 64's graphics capabilities to its limits, and were forced to compress or cut elements to fit the game on its 8 megabyte cartridge. Bugs delayed the game's release from September 1996 to January 1997. Critical reception of Turok was highly positive. Becoming one of the most popular games for the console on release, Turok won praise for its graphics and evolution of the genre. Complaints centered on graphical slowdowns caused by multiple enemies appearing onscreen and occasionally awkward controls. The game sold 1.5 million copies and boosted sales of the Nintendo 64.

Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands (\"hit troll\"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions (\"hit the troll with the Elvish sword\")."@en ,

The elevators do not follow any sort of linear route and must be reached by traversing and riding platforms on planets to reach any of the three elevators at the top of the chain. The platforms and elevators are guarded by creatures confusingly known as Zubs but each planet has a different sub-species - for example the first level's Zub resembles a gyroscope whilst he fourth level's is a fish. The Zubs can be shot and stunned. They will float to the top platform level and then descend to harass and attack Zub. The Green Eye of Zub was last located on the tenth planet and once the Eye is found, Zub has to return to the first planet to present the Eye of Zub to Emperor Zub. There are seven difficulty levels, each one increases the number of enemy Zubs per planet."@en ,

It is a re-imagining of the 1989 video game, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, which was originally developed by Imagineering for the NES. The game was originally released for the Wii in North America on October 13, 2009, and in Europe on November 6, 2009. A high-definition port of the game developed by Abstraction Games was released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on January 20, 2016. A PlayStation 3 version was made available on June 28 of the same year as a cross-purchase with the PS4 and Vita versions. WayForward's director Sean Velasco, a fan of the original NES title, expressed a desire to re-create and update the experience for current generation gamers, streamlining the NES title's gameplay mechanics to create a more \"forgiving\" experience. A Boy and His Blob's art direction has received widespread critical acclaim and praise, and was utilized by the developers, in addition to a minimalistic story, in order to create a \"heartwarming...and friendly game\" accessible to a wide audience."@en ;

The game was re-released by Sierra On-Line for Windows in 1995 as Command: Aces of the Deep. Aces of the Deep was the last installment of Dynamix's Aces series, which included the flight simulators Red Baron, Aces of the Pacific, and Aces Over Europe. However, unlike its predecessors, Aces of the Deep simulates a Kriegsmarine U-boat during the World War II. A unique feature was that Aces of the Deep came with a realistic Kriegsmarine War Grid map in which the player used in reference to finding their patrol zones. There is also an extensive in-game manual that covers the development of the U-boat, time-line based maps that show kill-to-loss ratios, and, on the CD-ROM version, video interviews with former German U-boat captains."@en .

It is a direct sequel to 2005's Battlefield 2, and the eleventh installment in the Battlefield franchise. The game was released in North America on 25 October 2011 and in Europe on 28 October 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. EA Mobile also confirmed a port for the iOS platform. The game sold 5 million copies in its first week of release, and received critical acclaim from most game reviewers. It is the first game in the series that does not support versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista as the game only supports DirectX 10 and 11. The PC version is exclusive to EA's Origin platform, through which PC users also authenticate when connecting to the game. The game's sequel, Battlefield 4, was released on 29 October 2013. In Battlefield 3's campaign, players take on the personas of several military roles: a U.S. Marine, an F-18 weapons system officer, an M1A2 Abrams tank operator, and a Spetsnaz GRU operative. The campaign takes place in various locations, including Iran to New York City; and follows the stories of Sergeant Henry Blackburn and Dimitri Mayakovsky. The full standard edition of Battlefield 3 (minus any DLC) was made free to download for Origin users from 28 May 2014 until 3 June 2014 as part of Origin's On The House promotion."@en ;

                                        ex:HasStory "Bayonetta is a third-person action game developed by PlatinumGames and published by Sega. The game was originally released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in Japan in October 2009, and in North America and Europe in January 2010. The game was later released on the Wii U alongside its sequel, Bayonetta 2, releasing in September 2014 in Japan and October 2014 in North America and Europe. Bayonetta takes place in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe. The game stars the titular character, a witch who is capable of shapeshifting and using various firearms. She also possesses magical attacks, and she can use her own hair to summon demons to dispatch her foes. The game features a rating system, which gives players a grade based on their performance, and a combat system that is similar to the Devil May Cry series. Development of the game was started in January 2007, with Hideki Kamiya being the game's director. According to Kamiya, the game was completely original, though he drew some inspirations from some Scandinavian mythology, and played Devil May Cry 4 for reference. The game's theme is \"sexiness\", and that the characters were designed to be \"fashionable\". Kamiya and artist Mari Shimazaki spent more than a year to create Bayonetta's design. Several demos were released for the game prior to its launch. Bayonetta was the third project released by PlatinumGames, which was founded by former Clover Studios' employees. Upon release, the game received very positive reviews. The game was praised for its combat, presentation and soundtrack, but was criticized for its story and quick-time-events. The game sold over 1.35 million units worldwide as of 2010, but Platinum was disappointed with the game's sales. The game was awarded and nominated for several end-of-the year accolades. An anime film adaptation of the game by Gonzo, titled Bayonetta: Bloody Fate, was released in Japan in November 2013."@en ;

The game is the logical extension of Tetris into the third dimension. In regular Tetris, the player manipulates a set of tetrominoes which fall into a two-dimensional pit (seen from the side). The aim is to solve a real-time packing problem by forming complete rows, which then disappear and score points. Poor play leads to incomplete rows, caused by inefficient arrangements of tiles; these rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces. Similarly, in Blockout, the player manipulates a set of polycubes which fall into a three-dimensional pit (seen from above; the pieces appear in the foreground and fall away). The pieces can be rotated around all three axes, and moved horizontally and vertically. The aim is to form complete layers."@en ;

The main character is King Bomber who rules over his kingdom. The object of the game is to conquer all the pieces of the Bomber country. Eventually you fight the main villain, Bagular, and his four henchmen. This is one of the earliest games in the Bomberman series to stray away from its party game roots and focus more on the single player component (though it did have a VS mode). It is the third Bomberman game for the Saturn, and the second for the PlayStation."@en ;

It is a sequel to Boom Blox, and was released on 19 May 2009 in North America and in Europe on 29 May 2009, where it is also known as Boom Blox Smash Party. The game features more than 400 new levels, and players are able to download new levels and upload their own custom-created levels to share online. Its development began after the completion of its predecessor, and it was formally announced on 28 January 2009. As with the original game, this sequel was also designed by film director Steven Spielberg. The gameplay of Boom Blox Bash Party resembles the original's, but features new mechanics. It also has less emphasis on the shooting mode, which the developers commented was their least favorite mode of play in Boom Blox. It was created as part of a deal between Electronic Arts and Steven Spielberg to make three original properties, though it does not count as one of the three original properties. As of April 2012, EA has shut down the online servers, meaning players can no longer upload and download user created games."@en ;

There are three editions: Arts & Letters, Math, and Sudoku. The Arts & Letters and Math versions were originally released on December 24, 2008 in Japan as launch titles for the DSiWare service, and the Sudoku edition on April 22, 2009 in Japan as well. The Math edition is the only version currently available outside Japan, and was released on April 5, 2009 in North America and June 19, 2009 in the PAL regions, as a launch title for the service. However, the Arts & Letters edition was released on August 10, 2009 in North America and October 23, 2009 in the PAL regions. The puzzles featured in both the Literature and Science editions were created by Ryuta Kawashima. One puzzle in each of these two editions utilizes the Nintendo DSi's camera function, while both versions allow players to use a photo for their in-game profile. On June 19, 2015, Brain Age Express: Sudoku was pulled from the DSi Shop and 3DS eShop, with no official reason given. Brain Age Math and Arts & Letters are pre-installed on North American Nintendo DSis."@en ;

Burnout Dominator is the second spin-off game in the Burnout series and sixth overall. It retains the core gameplay of the series, as players race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing \"reckless skill-based\" driving techniques. The versions for each platform do not interact with each other. This is the only Burnout game that was not developed by Criterion Games, and the first Burnout game in the series since Burnout 2: Point of Impact to not feature the \"Crash Mode\". At the time Dominator was being developed, Criterion was busy working on Burnout Paradise and was waiting to re-introduce the mode in a new form for the latter title. However, Criterion Games are listed as \"the makers of this game\" in the game manual and credited as developer on the official Electronic Arts site."@en ;

The game was developed and published by the Japanese company CyberStep, Inc. and has been officially released in several different countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and North America, with other areas like the EU, Germany and France preparing for official release. CosmicBreak is the sequel to another game by CyberStep, called C21 Steel Battle Chronicles, but contains more anime-styled characters, deeper developed story lines and offers thus more immersion. Several story lines have also been made into manga and short movies, which are connected to some of the quests in the game. As is the case with GetAmped2, Cosmic Break also has various NPCs and playable characters voiced by famous Japanese voice-over artists. Among these are Rie Tanaka (Icy, Ivis), Akio Ōtsuka (Draken), Takeshi Kusao (Lios), Asami Shimoda (Crimrose, Lily Rain), Atsuko Tanaka (Koko Gaap, Winberrl) and Daisuke Sakaguchi (Jikun Hu). In 2015, a sequel game, with different mechanics and cast, \"CosmicBreak 2\" was announced for development and had a Kickstarter campaign that barely succeeded in funding. Regardless, CosmicBreak 2 was released in the Summer of 2015 with a new cast of humanoid robots and an original story and is planned to continue service alongside its initial counterpart."@en ;

The game was distributed off their main site through a free download, as well as other distributors such as Download.com. The director, Peter Simard, was interviewed by Deborah Marshall of GarageGames in September 2008 for successfully developing an MMORPG with a pitifully small development team. Crowns of Power was showcased by Rampid Interactive at the E3 Expo in Los Angeles on June 2–4, 2009 at the Los Angeles Convention Center as an Exhibitor."@en ;

Croisière pour un cadavre) is an adventure game from Delphine Software International, made for the Amiga, Atari ST and IBM PC. The game is designed as a murder investigation. The player assumed the role of Raoul Dusentier, a man invited to spend some time on Niklos Karaboudjan's boat. Quickly after arriving, Karaboudjan is murdered, and the investigation begins. The game uses many references to French and Belgian pop culture. Karaboudjan is the name of The Adventures of Tintin character Captain Haddock's cargo ship in the comic The Crab with the Golden Claws. Just like in The Crab with the Golden Claws, crab cans are used to hide objects (in the comic they contain opium, whereas in the game they contain hand grenades).

It was released on December 25, 2002 for Japanese arcades, on October 9, 2003 for the Japanese PlayStation 2, and on September 21, 2004 for the North American PlayStation 2. This game is the ninth release in North America, but despite having the same name as its Japanese counterpart, its soundtrack is significantly different and won the Video Music Awards in 2005 on MTV for * Best Video Game Soundtrack. Despite its single-region arcade release, its popularity caused it to be exported or pirated and placed in game rooms worldwide. Examples of these bootleg titles are \"DDR MegaMix\" and \"DDR Extreme PLUS\". Dance Dance Revolution Extreme was the last game in the DDR Arcade franchise for 4 years until Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova in 2006. The arcade release of the game contains one of the largest soundtracks of any DDR game, featuring 240 songs, as well as music from other Bemani music titles. Konami issued an \"in-game\" thank you to the fans of Dance Dance Revolution and announced a rejuvenation of the entire series, but did not go into details. Konami's announcement led people to believe that DDR Extreme might be the last DDR release or that the series might be on hiatus or rebooted in the same manner as Beatmania and Beatmania IIDX. However, it continued to be released for video game consoles. It is possible that this meant the changes in SuperNova (the ability to have all difficulties at once and the massive difficulty spike) but this is unlikely."@en ;

The third game in the Souls series, Dark Souls II was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Although both are set in the same universe, there is no direct story connection between Dark Souls and Dark Souls II. The game uses dedicated multiplayer servers. Taking place in the world of Drangleic, the game features both player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) play, in addition to having some co-op components. As in the earlier games in the series, it again features challenging gameplay, but with a more powerful graphics engine and more advanced AI system. After some initial delays, the game was released worldwide in March 2014, with the Microsoft Windows version being released on April 24, 2014. An updated version of the game, Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, was released in April 2015. The title is a compilation of the original game and its downloadable content, and also encompasses a remastered port of the game for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows with upgraded graphics, expanded online multiplayer capacity, and other various changes. A sequel, Dark Souls III, was released in 2016."@en ;

The game featured vastly superior graphics, utilizing the Sega Model 3 hardware. The majority of Daytona USA 2 cabinets were released as deluxe models (with far fewer Twin Cabinets), which could be linked together for up to four players. A notable change from the original is the ability to select a car and corresponding driver, each with varying capabilities for varying levels of player experience. Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps with a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km), an Advanced course with 4 laps with a distance of 2.5 miles (4 km), and a long Expert course with 2 laps with a distance of 5 miles (8 km). The 'time lap' mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an \"ending\" and see the game credits. An addition to the game was the \"slingshot\", corresponding to advanced NASCAR drafting techniques.There are no home ports of Battle on the Edge and Power Edition. However, this game is emulated on the Supermodel 3 emulator that emulates the Sega Model 3 arcade hardware which is available for PC, Mac OS X, and Linux."@en .

First released in 2008 as a free-to-play modification for the Source game engine, the game was entirely redeveloped for a commercial release in 2012. Spurning traditional game design, Dear Esther features virtually no puzzles or tasks. The player's only objective is to explore an unnamed island in the Hebrides, listening to a troubled man read a series of letters to his deceased wife. Details of her mysterious death are revealed as the player moves throughout the island. While some reviewers challenged the status of Dear Esther as a video game, citing the minimal gameplay as a step away from convention, it received a generally positive critical reception. The game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 20 September 2016 under the name \"Dear Esther: Landmark Edition\". A spiritual successor, titled Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, was released for PlayStation 4 in August 2015 and for Microsoft Windows in April 2016."@en ;

The game was published by Genki in Japan on November 24, 2005 and by Konami in PAL regions in 2007. It is set in feudal Japan in the 16th century and revolves around a priestess who has been given eternal youth until she exterminates all the demons. She has been given charge of a mystical beast from the gods, Inugami, which is controlled by the player. The game is in vein of the well known Dynasty Warriors series, in which the player battles crowd after crowd of hostile enemies. The unique aspect of the game is that up to 65,535 enemies can be on-screen at once. Demon Chaos received mostly mediocre reviews, currently holding a 62 out of 100 on Metacritic."@en ;

A third game titled Doki Majo Plus was released on July 30, 2009. Similarly to the first game, players determine whether female characters are witches by touching their bodies with the stylus. However contrary to its predecessor, this title exhibits new features such as an enhanced witch check touching system and microphone input. The game resumes with Akuji, the main character of the first game, this time in high school.The game is rated D (17 years and over) in Japan by the CERO because of the nudity and sexual references presented in the game."@en ;

Mario) is a 1990 Mario arcade-style action puzzle video game designed by Gunpei Yokoi and produced by Takahiro Harada. Nintendo developed and published the game for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy consoles. The game's soundtrack was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka. The game focuses on the player character Mario, who assumes the role of a doctor and is tasked with eradicating deadly viruses. In this falling block puzzle game, the player's objective is to destroy the viruses populating the on-screen playing field by using colored capsules that are dropped into the field. The player manipulates the capsules as they fall so that they are aligned with viruses of matching colors, which removes them from play. The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each level. Dr. Mario received positive reception, appearing on several \"Best Nintendo Games of All Time\" lists. The game has been ported, remade, or has had a sequel on every Nintendo home console since the NES as well as most portable consoles, including a re-release in 2004 on the Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic NES Series. Modified versions of Dr. Mario exist as minigames in WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!, Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day!, and Brain Age: Concentration Training."@en ;

Developed and published by Square Enix, it is the tenth mainline entry in the Dragon Quest series, and the first online-only title in the franchise. Originally released for the Wii, it was later ported to Wii U and Microsoft Windows. Later cloud streamed versions were released for Android, iOS and Nintendo 3DS. Ports to the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch are also in development. The original version released in 2012, with expansion packs released in 2013 and 2015. Dragon Quest X is set in the world of Astoltia, with the player character being initially human before an attack by the Lord of Hell Nelgel forces their sole into the body of another race. Following this, they must gather magical gems to seal Nelgel once again, while the player character's sibling is sent back in time to be safe from Nelgel. Gameplay follows a combination of elements from the Dragon Quest and other contemporary MMORPGs, such as real-time combat in an open world environment and a job system tied to skills and abilities. Concepts for an MMORPG within the Dragon Quest series began among a small team during the later development of Dragon Quest VIII. Development progressed alongside that of Dragon Quest IX. The aim was to make it accessible to series fans and newcomers alike, along with creating a long-term content plan. The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama. New staff members included producer Yosuke Saito, who had previously worked on the Drakengard series and whose company Orca helped with development; and Chikara Saito, who joined as co-director in 2013. Dragon Quest X was confirmed in 2008, with its official reveal as an MMORPG coming in 2011. Critical reactions to the game have been positive overall, with praise going to its integrating of Dragon Quest features into an MMORPG structure. Updates have been created since its original release in addition to its expansions. The original version sold 700,000 copies in 2012. As of 2014, the game has sold over one million copies across all versions. Despite staff wishes for a Western release, Dragon Quest remains exclusive to Japan as of 2016 due to operational and localization difficulties."@en ;

The dragon's attacks include ramming, biting, grabbing & dropping, and breathing fire. Whenever Cael eats orcs, he gains Mana points. Eating farm animals replenishes Health. When Cael releases captured sprites, they give information or teach Cael about his magical powers. Orc forces include ground units (orc warriors), naval units (ships), air units (hot air balloons), castle defenses (towers), and war machines (catapults). There are many animations and cut scenes. The game was originally intended to be a Might and Magic title. The title originally going to be Dragon Wars of Might and Magic. However, as the story did not truly coincide with the Might and Magic universe the title was dropped."@en ;

Driveclub was announced during the PlayStation 4 press conference on 20 February 2013, and, after several delays, was released in October 2014. Driveclub is a racing game in which players compete in racing events around the world in a variety of different fashions. Players can compete in clubs with other players, earning a reputation as one of the best clubs, and leveling up to unlock better items. Another game mode is tour, essentially a campaign mode. Players can compete in standard races, as well as time trials, drifting events, and championship tournaments, which may take place in Norway, Canada, Scotland, India, Japan, and Chile. Players may customize their car, their club, or their driver, and may complete optional challenges during events. A weather system and day-night cycle is also in place. Driveclub was released to a fairly mixed critical reception. Critics praised the visuals, sound design, and the controls, but criticized the online playability, the inconsistent AI and a lack of gameplay variety. As of July 2015, the game has reached 2 million copies sold, becoming one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 video games. A VR version of Driveclub was announced by SIEJA and will release on 13 October 2016 as one of launch titles of PlayStation VR for Japan."@en ;

                                          ex:HasStory "Dying Light is an open world first person action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Polish video game developer Techland and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Announced in May 2013, it was released in January 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game was once planned to be released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but was later cancelled due to hardware limitations. The game revolves around an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who is sent to infiltrate a quarantine zone in a city called Harran. It features an enemy-infested, open-world city with a dynamic day and night cycle. The day-night cycle changes the game drastically, as enemies become more aggressive and more difficult to deal with during night time. The gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and parkour. The game also features an asymmetrical multiplayer mode (originally set to be a pre-order bonus); and a four-player, co-operative multiplayer mode. The development of the game began in early 2012. Prior to the game's official announcement, several reports claimed that Dying Light was a sequel to Dead Island, another franchise created by Techland. The rumor was later denied. The game's parkour system puts emphasis on natural movement. To implement that, Techland had to abandon most of the story elements, and had to build them again from scratch. The music development was handled by Paweł Błaszczak. According to him, the soundtrack was inspired by movie soundtracks of the '70s and '80s. At release, Dying Light received positive reviews from critics, with praise mainly directed at the combat, graphics, co-operative multiplayer, navigation and the day-night cycle, while receiving criticism regarding the story, difficulty and technical issues. The game was the best-selling title for the month of January 2015 and broke the record for the first month sales for a new survival horror intellectual property. Techland announced that they would be committed to the game after its release. As a result, in May 2015, they put another project on hold to concentrate on the post-release development of Dying Light. The team released numerous updates, and two downloadable content packages, namely Cuisine & Cargo and The Bozak Horde. An expansion, titled Dying Light: The Following was announced as well and was released on February 9, 2016."@en ;

First announced on January 10, 2007, it was released for Open Beta on Oct. 7, 2009. It was free to play with additional pay for bonuses. On August 8, 2010, SparkPlay Media announced it was likely going into bankruptcy and that it was actively holding an auction for Earth Eternal. The credit system was shut down and many of its items were made freely available. SparkPlay Media's CEO stated that unless a buyer was forthcoming, Earth Eternal would end when its webhost shut down the server for non-payment. However, on August 18, 2010, Earth Eternal was bought off in an auction. On August 31, 2010, the plug was pulled on the Earth Eternal website and game for lack of payment. It would appear that Earth Eternal has been bought by Japanese online game company Sankando. On July 21, 2011, the Earth Eternal website was reopened and the game was scheduled to be released in North America in Summer 2011. As of November 24, 2011 at 9 PM EST, the game and website once again went offline for an indefinite period of time."@en .

It follows the protagonist Petra, Emerald City's only private eye, as she is approached by a strange woman named Dee Gale. Dee's fiancé is missing, and she is willing to pay Petra above the going rate in order to find him. Lacking any other prospects, Petra agrees. What starts off as a simple missing person case soon takes Petra deep into the seedy underbelly of the Emerald City's criminal underground and beyond. She encounters many characters from the Oz canon and some new characters, learns several magic spells, and uncovers the answer to a dark secret that has haunted Petra all her life. Emerald City Confidential is a third-person, mouse-driven, adventure game in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the linear storyline to proceed. As a pure graphical adventure game, Emerald City Confidential follows the guidelines first introduced by LucasArts: it is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to fully immerse him/herself in Emerald City Confidential's universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need to save the game. With this in mind, there are no save game functions, but the player's position is automatically bookmarked and restored when the game is restarted. The game is set in the magical land of Oz, created by L. Frank Baum, as put through the gritty filter of 1940s film noir, with harsh city streets, grey rainy skies, femmes fatales, tough guys, trenchcoats, fedoras and plot twists. It's Oz, seen through the eyes of Raymond Chandler."@en ;

                                          ex:HasStory "Epic Mickey is a platform video game designed by Warren Spector and developed by Junction Point Studios for the Wii console. The game focuses on Mickey Mouse, who accidentally damages a world created by Yen Sid for forgotten characters and concepts, and is forced to fix the world while combating antagonists with a magic paintbrush. Epic Mickey notably features the first appearance of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit since 1943 as a major character, who was one of Walt Disney's first successful cartoon characters before the character was licensed under the ownership of Universal Studios. The character was regained by The Walt Disney Company in 2006 under the guidance of Bob Iger. The game also marks the first time that Oswald and Mickey ever appeared together. The game is much darker and more complex than previous Mickey Mouse games. Epic Mickey is part of an effort by Disney to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by placing less emphasis on his pleasant, cheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of his personality, focusing on the idea of depicting him as an epic hero. Spector collaborated with both Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios in conjunction with the project. The game was officially announced on October 28, 2009 in London and released in November 2010 in both Europe and North America."@en ;

Developed by EA Canada, it was published by Electronic Arts worldwide under the EA Sports label. It was released on 2 October 2009 in Europe, 30 September in Australia and 20 October 2009 in North America. It is available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Wii.

The English version features British commentators Martin Tyler and Andy Gray, while Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray were still become as commentator in PC, PS2, Wii and PSP. FIFA 10 is the second version of the game to sponsor a football club. Along with football magazine FourFourTwo, FIFA 10 is the co-sponsor of English League One club Swindon Town. The FIFA 10 logo appears on the front of the team's away shirt and on the back of the home shirt. It is the first FIFA game to do so since FIFA 07, which sponsored Accrington Stanley for the 2007–08 season."@en ;

The game was released on November 29, 2012 in Australia, November 30 in Europe, and December 4 in North America. A stand-alone expansion titled Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was released on April 30, 2013. Far Cry 3 is set on a tropical island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants. The third installment in the Far Cry series, Far Cry 3 was critically acclaimed upon release, with reviewers praising its world design, open-ended gameplay and story, while the game's multiplayer mode was criticized. Following the game's success, Ubisoft announced a successor, Far Cry 4."@en ;

Published by Square in 1991 on the original Game Boy, it later saw a North American re-release by Sunsoft in April 1998. Originally being developed under the name Gemma Knights, features gameplay roughly similar to that of the original The Legend of Zelda game, but with the addition of role-playing video game statistical elements. Along with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, Final Fantasy Adventure was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe. A remake, Sword of Mana, was released in 2003 changing the plot and many gameplay aspects. A second remake was released on mobile phones in Japan which only improved the graphics and music of the original version. A third remake, Adventures of Mana, was released for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita on February 4, 2016. The story follows the hero and the young heroine as they attempt to thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant, Julius, from destroying the Tree of Mana and dooming their world. The game was released with many familiar elements of the Final Fantasy series, such as Chocobos, but these were later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the Mana series. Final Fantasy Adventure was met with generally positive reviews at the time of its release. Over the course of time, reviewers have considered it one of the best action adventure games on the Game Boy. The game also spawned an entirely new game series, called the Mana series, which became a successful video game RPG franchise."@en ;

Several bonus features were added to each game, such as art galleries, bestiaries, and cutscenes—including computer-generated full motion video used at the beginning of Final Fantasy IV and anime scenes used throughout Chrono Trigger. Final Fantasy Chronicles was received well by players and critics, who praised the peripheral features and the fact that Square was offering RPG classics to a new generation of gamers. Conversely, reviewers sharply criticized \"long and frequent loading\" between areas and battles due to poor emulation. Enough copies of Chronicles were sold to warrant a second release as part of Sony's Greatest Hits in June 2003."@en ;

Originally released in 2000, it is the ninth title in the Final Fantasy series and last to debut on the original PlayStation console. In 2010, it was re-released as a PSone Classics title on the PlayStation Network. The game introduced new features to the series like the \"Active Time Event\", \"Mognet\", and a unique equipment and skill system. Final Fantasy IX's plot centers on a war between nations. Players follow a young thief named Zidane Tribal, who joins with others to defeat Queen Brahne of Alexandria, the one responsible for starting the war. The plot shifts, however, when the characters realise that Brahne is working with an even more threatening person called Kuja. Final Fantasy IX was developed alongside Final Fantasy VIII, but took a different approach by returning to the more traditional style of the early Final Fantasy games. Consequently, Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to other titles in the series. It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling 5.30 million units worldwide by March 31, 2003. Ports for iOS and Android were released in February 2016, while a port for Microsoft Windows was released in April 2016."@en ;

The game was released as a spin-off to Square's popular Final Fantasy series of video games. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was first released in North America in 1992 and marketed as a \"simplified role-playing game...designed for the entry-level player\" in an attempt to broaden the genre's appeal. The game's presentation and battle system is broadly similar to that of the main series, but it differed in its inclusion of action-adventure game elements. Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe. In the game, the player controls a youth named Benjamin in his quest to save the world. His goal is to reclaim a set of stolen crystals that determine the state of the world's four elemental powers. The gameplay takes a departure from the main series in a variety of ways. Many series staples are eliminated, such as random battles, save points, manual equipment, and the party system. The game received middling reviews and sales in North America and Japan, citing its simplified gameplay and lack of depth in the game's story. Over time, the game has kept the reputation for being a \"beginner's Final Fantasy\" and has been praised for its music."@en ;

It was directed by Yoshinori Kitase, written by Kazushige Nojima and Kitase, and produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi. The music was composed by Final Fantasy veteran Nobuo Uematsu, while the series' long-time character designer, Yoshitaka Amano, was replaced by Tetsuya Nomura. Released in 1997, it is the seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series and the first in the series to use 3D computer graphics, featuring fully rendered characters on pre-rendered backgrounds. It was also the first game in the main series to be released in Europe. The story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins the eco-terrorist rebel organization AVALANCHE to stop the world-controlling megacorporation Shinra from draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source. Cloud and his allies become involved in a larger world-threatening conflict and face off against Sephiroth, the main antagonist. Development of Final Fantasy VII began in 1994. It was originally developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, but was moved to the Nintendo 64; since the Nintendo 64's cartridges lacked the required storage capacity for substantial prerendered movie footage, Square moved the game to the CD-ROM based PlayStation. Helped by a large pre-release promotional campaign, Final Fantasy VII was a critical and commercial success. It was released in 1997 for the Sony PlayStation, in 1998 for Windows, in 2009 on the PlayStation Network, in 2012 on PC Digital Download, and in 2013 on Steam. In 2014, the game was released for Android and iPhone devices through the Japan-only streaming service \"Dive In\". On December 6, 2014, it was announced that Final Fantasy VII would be released on the PlayStation 4, with upscaled graphics. It has continued to sell solidly, with more than 11 million copies sold by 2015, making it the best-selling title in the series. Final Fantasy VII has been praised for its graphics, gameplay, music and story. Criticism has primarily pertained to its English localization. The iOS version of Final Fantasy VII was released on August 19, 2015, adding touch controls, an auto-save feature and the ability to disable random encounters. This was followed by the PlayStation 4 port with high speed mode finally releasing in December 2015 and on Android in July 2016. The game is acknowledged for having boosted the sales of PlayStation consoles and popularizing Japanese role-playing video games outside Japan. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest games of all time. The game's popularity has led to a series of prequels and sequels under the collective title Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Square Enix announced a high-definition remake of the game at E3 2015 for the PlayStation 4."@en ;

It is the fourteenth entry in the main Final Fantasy series and the second MMORPG in the series after Final Fantasy XI. Set in the fantasy realm of Eorzea, players take control of a customized avatar as they explore the land and are caught up in both an invasion by the hostile Garlean Empire and the threat of the Primals, the deities of the land's Beastmen tribes. Eventually, they are embroiled in a plot by a Garlean Legatus to destroy the Primals by bringing one of the planet's moons down on Eorzea. The game had been in development since 2005 under the codename \"Rapture\", and was announced in 2009 for Windows and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. It ran on Square Enix's Crystal Tools middleware engine, which was adjusted to suit the game's specifications. During development, the team carried over multiple aesthetic elements from XI while creating something that stood on its own. Due to several factors, the development was beset by problems that would later have drastic effects on the game. Attempts to bring the game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due to disagreements with Microsoft about the use of Xbox Live. After its alpha test and a delayed beta test, the game went live on September 30, 2010, remaining active until its servers were closed on November 11, 2012. At launch, the game received a mixed to negative reaction: while the graphics and music met with general praise, other aspects were unanimously panned, including the gameplay, interface, and the general impression of the game being unfinished at launch. Critic and fan backlash caused Square Enix to pull subscription fees, indefinitely postpone the PlayStation 3 version, and eventually develop an entirely new version of the game called Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn."@en ;

It is the fourteenth game in the Fire Emblem series, and the second to be developed for Nintendo 3DS after Fire Emblem Awakening. Fates was released in three versions, each following a different storyline centered around the same characters: Birthright and Conquest as physical releases, and Revelation as downloadable content. The overarching story follows the protagonist, a customizable Avatar created by the player, as they are unwillingly drawn into a war between the Kingdoms of Hoshido (their birthplace) and Nohr (their adopted home), and must choose which side to support. In Revelation, the Avatar rallies both sides against the true mastermind behind the war. The gameplay, which focuses around tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield, shares many mechanics with previous Fire Emblem games, although some elements are unique to each scenario. After the critical and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, with the staff of Awakening returning to their previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show all sides of the story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases. It also met with commercial success surpassing that of Awakening."@en .

The drivers on the front cover, from left to right are: Jean Alesi, Michael Schumacher and Mika Häkkinen. Other innovations included the pit lane speed limiter and a clutch. This game was a considerable and welcome improvement upon Formula 1 98. It may have lacked an \"arcade\" mode or that extra polish, but Studio 33 clearly concentrated on the most important aspects of the simulation mode, leaving the addition of an arcade mode for Formula One 2000. The AI was suspect, and often cheated the player when pulling out a substantial gap, the AI would then do impossible lap times to catch up and pass. This was also inherent in the Newmann Haas Game which Studio 33 also developed. Another AI tactic was to simply pass through solid walls when trying to overtake the player. This was especially noticeable in Monaco. Like usual, this game features in game commentary provided by Murray Walker and Martin Brundle. It was also the first F1 game to feature Jacques Villeneuve after he had prevented the use of his image and name for the 1997 and 1998 editions. During the making of this game, Psygnosis was taken over by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and became SCE Studio Liverpool. The game features all the drivers and tracks from the 1999 season, but does not represent the replacement drivers that featured in the real F1 season, therefore Mika Salo and Stéphane Sarrazin are not featured"@en ;

The game follows the basic structure of Formula One 06 for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The main differences include the updated visuals for the PS3 including a lot more detail, Sixaxis compatibility, real time reflections, car reflections on wet circuits and new wet weather effects. It was announced early in development that the safety car would be included in the game for the first time in an F1 game since Formula One 99 for the PlayStation. However, it was removed before the final release along with the PSP wing mirror integration shown at E3. The game also boasts dynamic weather, and improved AI. The AI system is called \"Live Action Racing\" where one can pressure the opposition, causing them to make little mistakes such as running wide on corners, causing them to crash into other cars or spin off the road of their own accord. The AI will then try to seek opportunities to pass the player in a realistic manner. The game is based on the early F1 season. Hence, Yuji Ide drives for Super Aguri when in reality he lost his super licence just 4 races into the '06 season, and Franck Montagny, then later Sakon Yamamoto took his seat. Other minor changes throughout the real 2006 season are also not represented. In the career mode, players begin by running tests for one of three teams (Toro Rosso, Super Aguri or Midland F1) at either the Silverstone, Magny Cours or Catalunya circuits. The tests given vary between the teams. When the player successfully completes the tests, they are given the role of test driver or race driver, depending on how well the player performed in the test. After performing well as a test driver, the player will become the second driver of the team. From there the player can compete in race weekends through many different roles. As a test driver the player will try out different car settings in practice, and as a driver the player will have track position targets to meet to keep the seat. The player's performances are subject to review at several points during the season. The initial release did not include force-feedback support, which is considered by many to be an important feature for simulation racing games used with driving wheel controllers. A subsequent update in early 2008 added force feedback. The game also lacks support for 1080i or 1080p output resolutions. Per the calendar, the Belgian Grand Prix is not included. The game's cover in the North America version (as seen on the right) features Fernando Alonso (the defending world champion at that time in 2006) who drove for the Renault team, Jenson Button who drove for the Honda team and David Coulthard who drove for the Red Bull Racing team. Like previous games, it featured in-game commentary from then ITV F1 commentators Martin Brundle and James Allen."@en ;

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online. Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero. The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game."@en ;

The game features 48 songs originally featured in five previous games in the series—Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Aerosmith—redesigning the songs to be based on master recordings and to include support for full band play first introduced to the series in Guitar Hero World Tour. The game was developed by Beenox, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane for release on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 systems and was released around the world in the second half of June 2009. The game reuses many elements from previous titles in the series, including Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero: Metallica. Beenox designed the game around playing the greatest songs of the series at venues located in the greatest places on Earth, and created venues based on various Wonders of the World for the game. While the game's soundtrack and expansion into a four-player band were well received by reviewers, the game was highly criticized for being a full-cost standalone title instead of being downloadable content for existing games in the series."@en ;

The game was released for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita with cross-play, on March 3, 2015 in North America and on March 4, 2015 in Europe, respectively. A version for Microsoft Windows was also released via Steam on December 7, 2015. It features couch or online co-op, or a combination of both, for up to four players. Helldivers takes inspiration from military science fiction such as Aliens and Starship Troopers. While solo play is possible, the intent is for two to four players to cooperate on missions to enemy-controlled planets. Almost every weapon or tool accessible to players can hurt their teammates, making discipline and coordination paramount."@en ;

The game was published by Devolver Digital and released on 23 October 2012 for Microsoft Windows. Set in 1989 Miami, the plot consists of two protagonists, Jacket and Biker, who have been receiving phone calls instructing them to commit massacres against the local Russian Mafia. The game blends top down perspective with stealth, extreme violence and surreal storytelling, along with a soundtrack and visuals influenced by 1980s culture. The game itself was influenced in part by Nicolas Winding Refn's 2011 neo-noir crime film Drive, as well as the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys. At release, the game received very positive reviews from critics, with praise regarding the narrative and themes, soundtrack, and gameplay. It is considered to be one of the best video games ever made. A sequel, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, was announced in 2013 and was released on 10 March 2015."@en ;

Originally titled Ikari (怒, \"Fury\") in Japan, Ikari Warriors was SNK's first major breakthrough US release and became something of a classic. The game was released at the time when there were many Commando clones on the market. What distinguished Ikari Warriors were rotary joysticks and a two-player mode. The player characters in Ikari Warriors are Colonel Ralf and Second Lieutenant Clark of the later King of Fighters series (known outside Japan as Paul and Vince in the Ikari series) battling through hordes of enemies. According to designer Keiko Iju, the game was inspired by the popular Rambo films and takes its name from the Japanese title of Rambo: First Blood Part II (Rambo: Ikari no Dasshutsu or \"The Furious Escape\"). Ralf and Clark also make an appearance as playable characters in Metal Slug 6 and Metal Slug 7, as well as the King of Fighters series."@en ;

The Japanese version was re-released in 1999 as Winning Eleven 3: Final Version with some slight improvements. The English commentary for the game is provided by Tony Gubba. Although it lacked FIFPro licence, it featured Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli along with German goalkeeper Andreas Koepke (on German release) and Paul Ince (on British release) on the cover. The cover of the Nintendo 64 version featured Colombian player Carlos Valderrama, and the game featured license from Reebok to use their logos in adboards and the Chilean kits. It is impossible to lose the match by accumulating too many red cards. After the third red card only yellows are shown. The Nintendo 64 version is called International Superstar Soccer 98, and was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka as a completely different game."@en ;

Originally developed for the Atari 8-bit family and the Commodore 64, Koronis Rift was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, MSX, Tandy Color Computer 3, and ZX Spectrum. The Atari and C64 version shipped on a flippy disk, with one version of the game on each side. A cassette version was also released for the Commodore 64. The Atari version required computers with the GTIA chip installed in order to display properly. Koronis Rift was one of two games in Lucasfilm Games' second wave (December 1985). The other was The Eidolon. Both enhanced the fractal technology developed for Rescue on Fractalus!. In Koronis Rift, the Atari 8-bit family's additional colors (over those of the Commodore 64) allowed the programmers to gradually fade in the background rather than it suddenly popping in as in Rescue, an early example of depth cueing in a computer game."@en ;

The sequel to Turtle Rock Studios's Left 4 Dead, the game released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in November 2009, and for OS X in October 2010, and for Linux in July 2013. Left 4 Dead 2 builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of zombies, known as the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and act extremely aggressive. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale. The gameplay is procedurally altered by the \"AI Director 2.0\", which monitors the players' performance and adjusts the scenario to provide a dynamic challenge. Other new features include new types of special infected and an arsenal of melee weapons. The game made its world premiere at E3 2009 with a trailer during the Microsoft press event. Prior to release, it received a combination of positive and negative critical and community reactions. It attracted an unusually high volume of pre-release controversy about the game's graphic content. In response, alterations were made to the cover art and both Australia and Germany refused to rate the unmodified edition at the time of release. After release however, the game was met with positive reviews by critics."@en ;

The game was released in North America on 18 January 2011, in mainland Europe on 19 January 2011, in Australia and New Zealand on 20 January 2011 and the UK and Ireland on 21 January 2011. It is a direct sequel to the critically acclaimed 2008 title LittleBigPlanet and the third game in the series following a PSP version released in 2009. Most of the more than 3 million levels created by users in the first game carry over and are playable and editable in LittleBigPlanet 2. Unlike its predecessor, which was marketed as a platform game, LittleBigPlanet 2 was marketed as a \"platform for games\". Support for PlayStation Move was added to the game through a software update in September 2011, allowing users to play the game using the PlayStation Move motion controller in conjunction with a Navigation Controller or gamepad."@en ;

                                        ex:HasStory "MIDI Maze is an early first person shooter maze video game for the Atari ST developed by Xanth Software F/X, published by Hybrid Arts, and released around 1987. It owes a significant debt to what may be the first of its genre, Maze War. The original MIDI Maze team consisted of James Yee as the business manager, Michael Park as the graphics and distributed processing guru, and George Miller writing the AI/drone logic. The game constructed multiplayer networks using the MIDI interface. It has been suggested that MIDI Maze introduced the concept of deathmatch combat. Up to 16 computers could be networked in a \"MIDI Ring\" by connecting one computer's MIDI-OUT port to the next computer's MIDI-IN port. Unless the computers were looped correctly, more than 4 players tended to slow down the game to a crawl and make it unstable. Graphically the game was very simple with a humorous twist. The game area itself occupied only roughly a quarter of the screen and consisted of a first-person view of a flat-shaded Pac-Man-like maze with a crosshair in the middle. All players were shown as Pac-Man-like smiley avatars in various colors. Bullets were represented as small balls. The game was started by one designated \"master\" machine, which set rules, divided players into teams, and selected a maze. A number of mazes were supplied with the game, and additional mazes could be constructed using a simple text-editor or one of various third-party tools. The game was very popular at gatherings of Atari ST users until the end of the Atari ST era, circa 1993. A prototype of MIDI Maze was found for the Atari 8-bit family. It is possible to connect ST and 8-bit to a network and play together. A three-day all-day MIDI Maze tournament is one popular attraction at Con of the North, a gaming convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota."@en ;

It is the second and final Mario Party game for the Wii, the ninth for Nintendo's home consoles, and the twelfth overall. It was officially announced at E3 2011 and was released in Europe, North America, and Australasia in March 2012, and in Japan in April 2012. It is the first of the Mario Party series to be developed by Nd Cube, as they took over development of the series from Hudson Soft, which was absorbed by Konami on March 1, 2012. Mario Party 9 is followed by Mario Party: Island Tour. It is also the final Mario game for the Wii, due to the release of the Wii U in November 2012."@en ;

It is the sequel to Mega Man ZX. Taking place a few years after the events of the first game, Mega Man ZX Advent follows two new protagonists, Grey and Ashe, as they battle with various enemy \"Mega Men\", the infamous \"Model W\", and their own destinies. The title plays very similarly to its predecessor with a multitude of expansions, including twice as many playable forms. Also different from its predecessor is the North American localization which now includes a full English voice cast. The game was first released in Japan on July 12, 2007. The North American version was released on October 23, 2007. It was released in Europe on February 29, 2008, and in Australia on March 5, 2008."@en ;

It was released on December 15, 1998 for Microsoft Windows and in 2001 for the Game Boy Color. The game is a collection of seven real pinball tables licensed by Gottlieb. These include: Baffle Ball (1931), Humpty Dumpty (1947), Knock Out (1950), Slick Chick (1963), Spirit of 76 (1975), Haunted House (1982), and Cue Ball Wizard (1992). The Game Boy Color version features scaled-down graphics, due to hardware limitations. It also excludes the Humpty Dumpty and Cue Ball Wizard tables. A free trial version of the computer game is also available, with Haunted House as the only playable table."@en ;

The fairly simple gameplay is centered on catching, with the cursor, different colored falling shapes that appear on screen in sync with the music playing in the background; shapes of some colors grant extra points while touching red notes incurs penalties. Music Catch has attained great popularity among flash gaming sites such as Kongregate. The song featured in the online version is titled \"Before Dawn\" and was written by Music Catch's developer, Isaac Shepard. In addition to being playable for free on the web, Reflexive Entertainment has also released a downloadable version that is available for purchase. The downloadable version of Music Catch includes the ability to play along to any MP3 in the user's library. Shepard has stated that this was his original intent all along, but the online version could not accommodate this feature, hence work began on the downloadable version. In May 2009, a version of Music Catch was released for the iOS. A sequel to the game, Music Catch 2, has also been released online."@en .

It was released in October and November 2009 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, and Wii. The eleventh installment in the NBA 2K series, it is the successor to NBA 2K9 and the predecessor to NBA 2K11. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is the cover athlete of the game. NBA 2K10 is the first game in the series to be released for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo Wii platforms; it is also the first game in the series to be released on a Nintendo console since NBA 2K3 was released for GameCube. The game strives to realistically depict the experience of basketball, and more specifically, the National Basketball Association. Players mainly play NBA basketball games in a variety of game modes with real players and teams as well as customizable players. MyPlayer mode is one of the new features; it in, players create their own player and play through their career in the NBA. A mode called Association is also present, in which the player assumes control of an NBA organization, and simulates through seasons. Online modes and quick play options among others are also available. In addition to the regular edition of the game, a limited edition, known as the Anniversary Edition, was also released; it included several bonuses, such as a poster and figurine. Only 30,000 copies of the Anniversary Edition were manufactured. A downloadable title available for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live, called NBA 2K10 Draft Combine, was released prior to the release of the main game; it tied into the main game's MyPlayer mode. NBA 2K10 received favorable reviews from critics upon release.

After EA Sports' rival publisher 2K Sports cancelled its own college basketball game, College Hoops, in 2008, EA changed the name of the series from NCAA March Madness to NCAA College Basketball. The series was discontinued on February 10, 2010. Like other games based on NCAA sports, it could not feature the players' names (as that is against NCAA policy/rules), so only the players' numbers were used in the rosters. Users were able to edit the rosters, putting in the correct names for each team if they wished to do so. Many player last names were built into the in-game commentary, like in the NBA Live series. Verne Lundquist, Brad Nessler, and Gus Johnson lent their voices for play-by-play in the games at various times. Lundquist was the original announcer, with Nessler taking over in the mid-2000s and Johnson joining him for the most recent game in the series. Bill Raftery and Dick Vitale were analysts. Raftery originally worked with Lundquist on their games and returned to work alongside Johnson for CBS-branded games in NCAA Basketball 10, while Vitale and Nessler joined the series at the same time."@en ;

The game was developed by EA Canada, published by EA Sports, and released in North America on September 7, 2010, with the game releasing in all other regions within two weeks. The game features a physics-based game engine, which replaced the old animation-based system, and was touted by NHL 11 producer, Sean Ramjagsingh, as \"the biggest change in NHL 11\". Other significant changes include broken sticks, which means the stick may now break when the player shoots. NHL 11 does not use official International Ice Hockey Federation jerseys, as the game doesn't have the IIHF license. The cover of NHL 11 features Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews, who helped the team win their first Stanley Cup title in 49 years in 2010. On January 11, 2013, all online services for NHL 11 were discontinued."@en ;

The game is a direct sequel to New Super Mario Bros., released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS and is the third New Super Mario Bros. side-scroller. The game was first released in Japan on July 28, 2012 and was released in Europe, Australia, and North America in August 2012, and is the first Nintendo-published game to be released simultaneously in both digital and physical forms. The game's plot is similar to its predecessors, focusing on Mario and Luigi's efforts to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings. New Super Mario Bros. 2 has a heavier emphasis on coin-collecting than other Super Mario games, with multiple unique items dedicated to producing large amounts of coins. The game features a specialized mode called \"Coin Rush\" that focuses exclusively on quickly completing a series of stages while collecting as many coins as possible. Additional Coin Rush stages were made available for purchase as downloadable content shortly after the game's release. New Super Mario Bros. 2 received positive reviews; it currently holds aggregate scores of 78.59% and 78% on GameRankings and Metacritic. Critics generally praised the game's level design but criticized the game for being too similar to earlier New Super Mario Bros. games. New Super Mario Bros. 2 is the fifth best-selling game for the Nintendo 3DS, selling 10.39 million copies worldwide as of June 30, 2016."@en ;

Wii (New スーパーマリオブラザーズ Wii Nyū Sūpā Mario Burazāzu U~ī) is a 2009 side-scrolling platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. The game was released internationally in November 2009, and in Japan on December 3, 2009. It is the first game in the Mario main series since Mario Bros. to feature simultaneous multiplayer gameplay, and the first title to include Nintendo's new \"Super Guide\" feature. To highlight the uniqueness of the title, Nintendo chose to use a red keep case instead of the traditional white. The game is also the first Mario sidescroller to have up to four player multiplayer. The game’s plot is similar to those of other side-scrolling Mario games. New Super Mario Bros. Wii follows Mario as he fights his way through Bowser's henchmen to rescue Princess Peach. Mario has access to several power-ups that help him complete his quest, including the Ice Flower, the Fire Flower, and the Starman, each giving him unique abilities. While traveling through up to nine worlds with a total of 80 levels, Mario must defeat Bowser's children (the Koopalings and Bowser Jr.), Kamek, and Bowser himself before finally saving Princess Peach. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was critically and commercially successful. As of March 31, 2016, it is the fourth best-selling game on the Wii, at 29.79 million copies sold worldwide. It received several honors, including the Best Wii Game award from the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, IGN, and GameTrailers. A follow-up to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, entitled New Super Mario Bros. 2, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in August 2012. A direct sequel, New Super Mario Bros. U, was developed for the Wii U console and launched with the system in November 2012."@en ;

A port for the PlayStation Portable was released in 2006 in Japan and in 2007 in North America and Europe.

It is one of seven games released for the DSi's Art Style series of video games. It was announced on January 26, 2009, and was released two days later alongside Somnium, another Art Style game, and was released in North America and PAL regions in the same year, on May 18 and May 22 respectively. In PiCOPiCT, players use the touch screen to move coloured blocks into a formation, such as a four block line or a 2x2 square. This contributes to an 8-bit image, which consist of various Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) characters, such as Mario, Link, and Bowser. PiCOPiCT was an anticipated release due to its presentation. Since its release, PiCOPiCT has received very positive reception from publications such as IGN, GameSpy, and writer Stephen Totilo. It was nominated for best DS puzzle game of the year from IGN, and won best DSiWare game of the year from Nintendo Life. It had critics, including Pocket Gamer and GameSpot, the latter finding it too difficult and imprecise. A fellow developer of downloadable video games, Gaijin Games, praised it for its gameplay and presentation. It received some attention in sales, appearing on the DSiWare's top 20 best-selling games chart for several weeks following its release, peaking at 10. It has been compared to Tetris by several people, though UGO's Paul Furfari bemoaned such a comparison, saying that its presentation set it apart."@en ;

However, in 2004, after displaying a message on the site for nearly a year that Planet Hot Wheels would be back soon, Hot Wheels permanently removed the game from the website with no warning issued to its players. Many Hot Wheels fans played the game and speculations have been made on why the game was removed, but Mattel has not made any official statements. Many players enjoyed the virtual racing game because of the Highway 35 story features and because of its use of real world Hot Wheels' models and the ability to upgrade their cars with decals, paint jobs, weapons, and other assorted components. To get these parts players could buy specially marked Hot Wheels cars and enter a code to get an item. Users could also race and play mini-games to earn credits, the currency of Planet Hot Wheels, and purchase items with them."@en ;

The games are part of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. First released in Japan on September 12, 2009, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe during March 2010. HeartGold and SoulSilver take place in the Johto region of the franchise's fictional universe, which features special creatures called Pokémon. The basic goal of the game is to become the best Pokémon trainer in the Johto and Kanto regions, which is done by raising and cataloging Pokémon and defeating other trainers. Game director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it felt like a new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. Reception to the games was highly positive, with the two being amongst the highest rated DS games of all time on Metacritic. As of March 2014, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million, putting the titles amongst the best selling Nintendo DS games."@en ;

The game was officially announced on 18 June 2007. Its title is different from the other Pro Evolution Soccer games in that it's of a year and not a version; this was due to EA Sports' FIFA series naming their titles with two digit numbers (i.e. 07, 08) and in conclusion would seem that PES was a year behind FIFA (to non-fans which had no knowledge of the previous games of the franchise). It was released for Windows, Wii, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and mobile phone. The PC version in this game is used the same engine as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 for the first time. A PS3 demo is available for download from the PlayStation Store, a Xbox 360 demo has been released on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and a PC demo has been released."@en ;

Last Specter is the fourth game in the Professor Layton series, and is a prequel that takes place three years before the first trilogy, detailing how Professor Layton met his apprentice, Luke Triton and introducing Layton's assistant Emmy Altava. Professor Layton and the Last Specter also includes an additional role-playing game entitled Professor Layton's London Life, available from the start of the game. London Life, in which players interact with various characters from the series in a town called \"Little London\", was advertised as having over 100 hours of content. London Life was removed from the European versions of the game because the translation of texts would have significantly delayed the game's release. The game was released during 2009 in Japan, and was the highest-selling game there during the week of its release. It saw release in North American and PAL regions during 2011."@en ;

It is a multiplayer online racing game (MMORG) with partially chargeable content, or micro-transactions. It features gameplay elements such as tuning and customization. The game is titled as Level R in Europe with a slightly different game interface and menus. Europe, US, Russia, Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Japan versions, are developed by Invictus Games and are subject to Invictus copyright. Level-R was originally developed for the Japan market in 2006, which was based on CRC2005. The Level-R versions across the world will all be the same with minor physics and content tweaks. The current build, Julia, was released on June 3, 2010. Beta versions from Invictus can be found on the Invictus Beta site. The Level-R versions combined with the Project Torque version have 64 cars in total. None of the versions have all 64 cars due to licensing issues, and any version may not receive a certain car if it does not gain proper licensing. As of July 31, 2010, the Project Torque service, hosted by Aeria Games Entertainment, is no longer in service. Invictus Games Ltd. signed a deal with Innologin Ltd. to publish a new North American service of Level-R, called Heat Online. As of May 1, 2014, the HEAT Online service has been discontinued."@en ;

The game was announced at The Game Awards 2015 in December, and is planned for release in 2018. Double Fine and game director Tim Schafer had expressed desire to create the sequel to Psychonauts, but the financial demand of developing the game stalled any serious attempt. After strong sales of the original through various outlets along with strong demand from the fanbase of the original game, Double Fine sought to acquire part of its financial capital to fund the developments of Psychonauts 2 through a $3.3 million crowd-funding and investment drive through Fig, launched simultaneously with the game's announcement. The campaign raised a total of over $3.8 million by January 2016."@en ;

The game is unique in that it combines street racing with role-playing elements. The game's story follows a new member of a street racing team in 1999 Yokohama, Japan as he tries to learn about his forgotten past and a mysterious race that took place ten years prior to the game's opening. Released for the PlayStation, the game is compatible with the Sony PocketStation. The game's music was composed by Noriko Matsueda as a jazz/techno fusion; she was joined by Takahito Eguchi as his first compositional role, and the soundtrack was released as an album. The game received poor reviews in Japan and was never released outside of the country, but still sold over 100,000 copies."@en ;

It was released on December 29, 2010. In Raskulls, players must navigate through platform-based levels filled with blocks of varying shape and size. The characters must use their brick-breaking wands to create the fastest route to the end of the level. Raskulls received above average reviews from critics. Reviewers praised the comic character design, humorous dialogue and emotions, and overall gameplay. Many reviewers praised the number of game modes and the multiplayer component as well, however some reviewers felt the game would not keep its novelty as it aged. Initial sales were high, with over 19,000 units sold during the month of its release. Year-end 2011 sales were in excess of 101,000 units."@en ;

It is based on a modified version of their Temple of Apshai game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family. The game requires the player to search out a space fortress looking for ten hostages. Presented in a top-down view, the player can only see the area immediately around them, so the entire base has to be searched room by room. There is a 60 minute time limit on the mission. Rescue at Rigel was soon followed by Star Warrior, and the two rebranded to be part of their \"Starquest\" series, although Star Warrior used a more heavily modified game engine than Rigel."@en ;

The ninth main installment of the Resident Evil series, it was first released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 2 October 2012, and for Microsoft Windows on 22 March 2013. It was re-released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with all downloadable content on 29 March 2016. The story is told from the perspectives of Chris Redfield, a former member and founder of the Bio-terrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) traumatized by a failed operation; Leon S. Kennedy, a Raccoon City survivor and agent for the US government; Jake Muller, an illegitimate son of Albert Wesker and associate of Sherry Birkin; and Ada Wong, a freelance agent framed for the bio-terrorist attacks by the antagonistic corporation Neo-Umbrella. They must all confront the force behind a massive bio-terrorist attack with the newly developed C-virus in cities across the world. Gameplay is centered around their four interwoven storylines, in which each player-character has unique abilities and styles. The game was first conceptualised in 2009, with full development commencing the following year under Resident Evil 4 producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi. Resident Evil 6 had a development staff of more than 600, making it Capcom's largest production to date. The developers define the game's genre as \"dramatic horror\", although promotional materials for the Japanese version still classify the game as survival horror. The game received mixed reviews from critics upon release; some reviewers praised the game's storyline and themes, however the four interwoven campaigns were criticised, as well as the game's departure from the survival horror genre. Despite the criticisms, it was a financial success; with over 6 million copies sold, it currently stands as Capcom's second best-selling game. A sequel, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, is set to be released in January 2017."@en ;

The game is developed by Backbone Entertainment in conjunction with Harmonix and is distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009. The core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, Frequency and Amplitude, with the player responsible for playing all four instruments—lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals—using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to Rock Band's, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the Rock Band series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to Unplugged before they are released as downloadable content for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the PlayStation Store. Rock Band Unplugged, in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a \"Limited Edition Entertainment Pack\" that also includes a Rock Band Unplugged-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie School of Rock.

It represents landmarks in two key areas of Internet development: games and multicasting, and notable advancement in creating rendered virtual environments. Dogfight might more properly be referred to as three programs, flight, dog, and shadow. Flight is a flight simulator, dog is an air combat game in which multiple people use the flight interface to control their aircraft, and shadow is an observation program that allows a user to see what a user of either dog or flight sees. The following planes were available: 
*  Cessna 
*  P-38 Lightning 
*  Boeing 747 
*  F-16 
*  F-15 (F-14 model; wings spread) 
*  F-14D (wings laid on) Later versions added: 
*  different F-16 geometry 
*  F-18 
*  Boeing 727 In some intermediate version (between 1985 and 1995) aircraft inspired by Star Wars (Xwings, ...) were added. They disappeared in later versions."""@en ;

                                            ex:HasStory "Scribblenauts is an emergent puzzle action video game developed by 5th Cell and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the Nintendo DS. The game was released on September 15, 2009 in North America, September 30, 2009 in Australia, October 9, 2009 in Europe and on January 27, 2011 in Japan as Flash Puzzle: Maxwell's Mysterious Notebook (ヒラメキパズル マックスウェルの不思議なノート Hirameki Pazuru: Makkusuweru no Fushigi na Nōto) by Konami. It is the third Nintendo DS video game made by 5th Cell, the first two being Drawn to Life and Lock's Quest. The objective of Scribblenauts, as implied by its catchphrase \"Write Anything, Solve Everything\", is to complete puzzles to collect \"Starites\", helped by the player's ability to summon any object (from a database of tens of thousands) by writing its name on the touchscreen. The game is considered by its developers to help promote emergent gameplay by challenging the player to solve its puzzles within certain limitations or through multiple solutions. Jeremiah Slaczka, creator and director of Scribblenauts, envisioned the game as a combination of solving life situation puzzles alongside Mad Libs. His vision was brought to realization through the \"Objectnaut\" engine created by 5th Cell's technical director, Marius Fahlbusch. Objectnaut allowed for a data driven approach, and a significant portion of the development time was spent researching nouns and their properties, and categorizing them into the Objectnaut database. This, along with the simple art designs of 5th Cell's Edison Yan, allowed for the team to easily add new words to the database without expending much effort to program new behavior. Scribblenauts was first shown in a playable form at the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo, and became a sleeper hit, winning several \"Best of Show\" awards, being the first portable console game to win such praise. Reviewers believed that 5th Cell delivered on their promise to allow nearly any possible object to be created for use in Scribblenauts, but also lamented that the choice of controls in the game hampered their full enjoyment of the title. The success of the title has led to a number of sequels including Super Scribblenauts, Scribblenauts Remix, and Scribblenauts Unlimited. The series has sold over 13 million copies."@en ;

The only other control input was a single button, allowing the player to perform a jumping attack. The use of the trackball has subsequently led to great difficulty in emulation efforts, with Yuji Naka stating it as the reason for it not being included on future compilations or rereleases, such as Sonic Gems Collection."@en .

Originally commercial and subscription-driven, Shadowbane was launched in March 2003, and was the creation of text-MUD veterans J. Todd Coleman, James Nance, Josef Hall, Patrick Blanton and Robert Marsa and a team of 45 programmers, designers and artists. It closed on July 1, 2009. Shadowbane was a top-10 best selling PC game at launch, and had two noteworthy aspects. First, the majority of the game world allowed for open player versus player combat, making it an early pioneer title in the PvP MMO genre. Second, it was the first major MMO to offer dynamic world content as a primary feature of the game. Most MMOs are static, meaning the world itself does not change based on player actions. Dynamic worlds allow player to change the game world itself; morphing terrain, building and destroying buildings and fortifications, and setting up patrol paths for player-hired AI combatants. The game was considered a \"cult hit\" and sustained a small base of followers, but technical issues plagued the game at launch and failed to retain much of the early fanbase shortly afterward. After the sale of Wolfpack Studios to Ubi Soft in March 2004, the live service was transitioned to a new management and (largely new) development team, led by Frank Lucero and Ala Diaz. This team later splintered off to become Stray Bullet Games in June 2006, and Mark Nuasha was brought in to run the organization. On March 15, 2006 the game was made free-to-play. A system of short ads was introduced on March 6, 2007 to fund operating costs, which are displayed when the game is opened or closed and when a character dies (with at least 10 minutes between death ads). On March 19, 2008, all servers were closed to prepare for the \"Shadowbane Reboot,\" a relaunching of the game to capitalize on stability and performance gains hindered by previously existing data. All player characters and cities were deleted in this reboot. On March 25, 2008, the fifth anniversary of the game's launch, two servers were brought online followed by a third due to overpopulation. The game was closed the following July. The regular game took place in a dark fantasy world called Aerynth (the world will sometimes depend on the servers, many of which have unique world maps). Gameplay features many aspects typical of role-playing video games, such as experience points, character classes, and fantasy races. Character creation was fairly extensive, allowing for detailed, differentiable characters to be created."@en ;

It is the third installment in the Silent Hill series and a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game. It was released in May 2003, with a port to Microsoft Windows released in October of the same year. A remastered high-definition version titled Silent Hill HD Collection was released for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 20, 2012. Set seventeen years after the events of Silent Hill in which Harry Mason defeats the god of the town cult and is given a baby girl to care for, Silent Hill 3 focuses on Heather Mason, a teenage girl raised by Harry in Portland. She discovers that the cult plans to use her to birth their god, and becomes caught in a conflict within the cult. Silent Hill 3 was mostly well received by critics, especially in its presentation, including the environments, graphics and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes that are continued from past installments. Its plot was loosely adapted into the 2012 film Silent Hill: Revelation 3D."@en ;

Directed by Hideo Kojima, along with Guillermo del Toro, it was to be the ninth main installment in the Silent Hill series. Kojima was brought onto the project in September 2012 by Konami; the game was announced in August 2014 via P.T., short for Playable Teaser, a critically acclaimed demo that was released as a free download from the PlayStation Store. P.T. revealed the involvement of Del Toro, along with Norman Reedus as the voice and appearance of its protagonist. The game's development was questioned due to rumors surrounding Kojima's work with the completion of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and his eventual exit from Konami. In April 2015, reports surfaced from del Toro that Silent Hills had been cancelled, with Konami officially confirming the cancellation shortly after, a move which was negatively received by critics and fans of the franchise."@en .

The original Shockwave version launched in 2000 but went offline in early 2009. A successful Kickstarter campaign was launched in early 2013 by some members of the original development team, who announced the re-release of the game as open source in HTML5. The original date for the game's relaunch was September 2013, but was delayed. An open beta test, started on 30 July 2014, is currently underway. The gameplay is simple on its surface, but requires solid strategy to win consistently. The graphics are also simple, and were inspired by the work of \"outsider artist\" Henry Darger, illustrator Edward Gorey, Japanese anime, and early, 8-bit video games of the 1980s. The game, which was inspired in part by Lucasfilm's pioneering online role-playing game, Habitat, was designed to ignite community-building through chat both in the game and on its associate message boards. In a departure from the androcentric norm in video games, all of the players in Sissyfight were rendered female and nonsexual. Sissyfight is often cited as an early example of a web-based MMOG in gaming development and academic circles. Although each game session only contained three to six players at a time, the mechanics of \"brownie points\" and the robust community surrounding Sissyfight created a much more \"massive\" experience than most small-scale web games."@en ;

It was remade for the Xbox 360 in 2012, with ports to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and then back to Microsoft Windows. The player controls a spelunker who explores a series of caves while collecting treasure, saving damsels, fighting enemies and dodging traps. The caves are procedurally generated, making each run through the game unique. Spelunky is one of the first examples of a roguelike-like, borrowing concepts from the roguelike genre, and was the influence for many later roguelike-like games. The first public release was on December 21, 2008. The source code of the 2008 Windows version was released on December 25, 2009. An enhanced version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on July 4, 2012. The enhanced edition was also released on PC on August 8, 2013 and for PlayStation 3 on August 27 and 28, 2013 and for PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2014. A Chrome OS version of the game was made as well, titled Spelunky HTML5"@en ;

It is the first game Data East developed and released for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware. Its character designs are almost identical to the ones in Data East's Sega Genesis / Mega Drive game titled Dashin' Desperadoes; however, the rest of both games are completely different. In fact, they are so different that Will, Rick, and Jenny go by Tom, Johnny, and Mary in Spinmaster. Also, Spinmaster's gameplay, artwork style, animations of some characters and the styles of its weapons were heavily inspired by another arcade game by Data East titled Joe & Mac, according to the Japanese Miracle Adventure arcade flyer. After Data East became defunct due to its bankruptcy back in 2003, G-Mode bought the intellectual rights to the Neo-Geo game as well as most other Data East games and licenses them globally. The game was later re-released on the Virtual Console in Japan on August 3, 2010, the PAL region on November 12, 2010 and in North America on November 22, 2010."@en ;

Fortier and published by Disney Interactive. The game, marketed as \"The Stunt Flying and Filming Simulation\", provides an island which contains a number of different film sets, such as a city, an oil rig, a canyon, and an aircraft carrier. The player can position cameras and props around these sets, and create triggers to start actions including the camera panning and an object moving. The game also has an editing mode where the player can splice together taped footage and insert sound effects. The game has a bias towards airplane stunts."@en .

It was directed by Doug Church with Warren Spector serving as producer. The game is set aboard a space station in a cyberpunk vision of the year 2072. Assuming the role of a nameless hacker, the player attempts to hinder the plans of a malevolent artificial intelligence called SHODAN. System Shock's 3D engine, physics simulation and complex gameplay have been cited as both innovative and influential. The developers sought to build on the emergent gameplay and immersive environments of their previous games, Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds, by streamlining their mechanics into a more \"integrated whole\". Critics praised System Shock and hailed it as a major breakthrough in its genre. It was later placed on multiple hall of fame lists. The game was a moderate commercial success, with sales exceeding 170,000 copies, but Looking Glass ultimately lost money on the project. A sequel, System Shock 2, was released by Looking Glass Studios and offshoot developer Irrational Games in 1999 and a third game is currently in development by Otherside Studios. The 2000 game Deus Ex and the 2007 game BioShock are spiritual successors to the two games. A remade version of the original game by Night Dive Studios is scheduled for release in 2017."@en ;

It is the first game in Tapulous' Tap Tap series. Development for the game began prior to the release of the iPhone SDK, and was originally entitled Tap Tap Revolution. The goal of the game is to tap each of the colored balls when they reach a line at the bottom of the screen. If the ball is hit on the beat, the player gains points, but if not, it counts as a miss. There are also \"shakes\", which require the player to move the iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad (although the game was designed for the former two) to the right, left, or middle. The game's reception was generally positive, and it became the most downloaded free game of the App Store for 2008. The game was followed by Tap Tap Revenge 2, Tap Tap Revenge 3 and Tap Tap Revenge 4. Via a post on their Facebook page, as of January 2014 the game has been removed from the App Store by owner Disney and it no longer plans to support the game."@en ;

Originally announced at Gamescom 2014, the game is an expanded remake of the 2013 PlayStation Vita game Tearaway, which was also developed by Media Molecule. Tearaway Unfolded, like the Vita original, takes place in a vibrant storybook-type world made almost entirely out of paper. The player gains control of one of Iota or Atoi, a Messenger tasked with delivering a letter to a portal in the sky called 'the You', which has mysteriously been opened. However, the messenger must also save the world from Scraps, small villainous creatures which are invading the paper world via the opening to cause disruption. Tearaway Unfolded's gameplay revolves around environmental platform interaction, creativity and customizability, confrontations with Scraps and other antagonistical creatures, mini-quests issued by non-playable characters, and finding collectibles. The player, who controls several aspects of the world in a god-like fashion, navigates the messenger through the environments by changing the landscape. For example, in order to help Iota/Atoi advance through a specific section, the player may have to trigger bounce pads, rotate platforms, illuminate objects, cast gusts of wind, or hurl objects, to trigger the solution and allow progression. The player is tasked with designing objects for use in the game's world, which are mostly used to solve people's problems or requests, but may also be used for decorative purposes. The messenger is given several helpful tools over the course of the game, which introduce new gameplay mechanics, and, among other things, allow for alternate methods of traversal. Tearaway Unfolded was met with a positive critical reception upon release. Critics mostly praised the game's controls, visuals, characters, and world design. Some critics disliked the emphasis on optional controllers, while others felt that the original PlayStation Vita version was a more personal experience, and therefore, better overall. Despite the positive reviews, the game was considered a commercial disappointment."@en ;

It is the first game in the SaGa series and the first role-playing video game for the system. Square translated the game into English for worldwide release and renamed it, linking it with the Final Fantasy series to improve marketing. Sunsoft re-released it in North America during 1998; Square followed with an enhanced update released for the WonderSwan Color and mobile phones in 2002 and 2007 respectively. The Final Fantasy Legend operates on a turn-based system similar to that of Final Fantasy II. The game's characters battle monsters and fiends using a variety of weapons, armor, and skills that develop through the player's actions. The game follows the story of four heroes who attempt to scale a tower at the center of the world that supposedly leads to paradise. The four heroes may belong to one of three character classes, each housing a unique customization path. The Final Fantasy Legend was conceived by Nobuyuki Hoshino and developed under director Akitoshi Kawazu; renowned composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote its score. The game is Square's first million seller with 1.37 million units shipped. Though released to mixed reception, it has since been described as one of the Game Boy's greatest games and cited as an influence for series such as the Pokémon franchise."@en ;

They were released on February 19, 2009 as Perfect Sun (パーフェクトサン Pāfekuto San), Missing Moon (ミッシングムーン Misshingu Mūn), and Wandering Star (ワンダリングスター Wandaringu Sutā) for the PlayStation Portable as a port of The Idolmaster. The gameplay in SP features changes from its predecessor, including an additional promise system which puts more of a focus on communication. The games include three game modes: two single-player and one multiplayer mode for up to three players. The story is told from the perspective of a producer in charge of training 10 prospective pop idols on their way to stardom, and each version of SP features different idols. One reason for dividing SP among three versions when developing the games was to allow players to buy the version which features their favorite idols. Rival idols were introduced into SP because the development team felt that rivals are essential for The Idolmaster, which also serve to deepen the bonds between the player and an idol. Including downloadable content, the game features 54 songs the idols perform: 34 songs in original versions and 20 remixes of those songs, which have been released on several music albums. The three versions of SP sold 129,088 units collectively in their first week of sales, and together ranked as the second best-selling video games in Japan that week."@en ;

The game was released in Japanese arcades in 1999 and was ported to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit. A Windows version was released in 2000 and a PlayStation 2 port followed in 2004. The Typing of the Dead is a modification of Sega's 1998 light gun arcade game The House of the Dead 2 in which the gun is replaced by a computer keyboard. The player takes the role of a secret agent in a zombie-infested Venice and must quickly type letters, words and phrases in order to kill fast-advancing enemies. Despite falling under the criteria of \"edutainment\", the game was lauded by mainstream game critics for its humor, difficulty and originality. The PC version of The Typing of the Dead sold 120,000 units in 2003. A Sony PlayStation 2 port was called The Typing of the Dead: Zombie Panic. This version was released exclusively in Japan in late December 2004 and was packaged with a USB keyboard. The game was mostly unchanged, although the Dreamcast backpacks were replaced with PS2 backpacks and new minigames were incorporated into the main story. A sequel, The Typing of the Dead 2, was released exclusively in Japan in 2007. English of the Dead, another revision of House of the Dead 2, was released as a language-learning game for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2008. In 2012, an iOS remake was released entitled Flick of the Dead. Typing of the Dead: Overkill, based on The House of the Dead: Overkill, was released on Microsoft Windows in October 2013."@en ;

It was later ported to the PlayStation game console, being released on December 11, 1997; in 2009, it has been also made available as downloadable content in the PlayStation Store, for the PlayStation 3 and the PSP. Both the original arcade version and the PS version were released in Japan only, and the downloadable version for PS3 and PSP remains in Japanese language. Angel Eyes featured an all-female character roster, in the same way as other fighting games with all-female rosters like Metal & Lace: Battle of the Robo Babes, Variable Geo, Seifuku Densetsu Pretty Fighter, Arcana Heart and Asuka 120%. In a similar way to Capcom's Justice Gakuen series, most of the characters were teenage students fighting for the honor of their school and to earn the right of becoming the Great Angel. The game sported very high-quality, manga-styled character artwork, vigorous animation and attractive backgrounds. Contributing to the game's uniqueness, its visuals combined two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics. Angel Eyes has remained mostly in obscurity in the West, due to not being released outside Japan. In Japan however, it gained a moderate success and following, and is still being used in tournaments there."@en ;

It was powered by an original gameplay and physics engine that now bears the game's name, and had been in development for over three years in founder Tim Sweeney's garage before the game was released. Since the release of Unreal, the franchise has had one sequel and two different series based on the Unreal universe. One official bonus pack, the Epic-released Fusion Map Pack, can be downloaded free of charge. Unreal Mission Pack: Return to Na Pali was released in June 1999, and added 17 new missions to the single player campaign of Unreal. Unreal and Return to Na Pali would later be bundled together as Unreal Gold. Additionally, the games were updated to run on the Unreal Tournament version of the game engine."@en ;

Released in 2010, it is the second game in the Valkyria series of games and the sequel to Valkyria Chronicles. Set two years after the onset of the Second Europan War, the game's story focuses on a military academy as its cadets seek to prevent an ethnic cleansing campaign by a ruthless rebel group. Upon release, Valkyria Chronicles II received mostly high scores from several notable video game publications. A third game in the series, Valkyria Chronicles III, which is also on the PlayStation Portable, was released on January 27, 2011 in Japan. However, as the game takes place around the same time as the first game, it is a prequel to Valkyria Chronicles II."@en ;

Like its predecessor, Victoria II allows for the player to take control of and manage a 19th-century state including its political, diplomatic, economic, military, and technological aspects. The game has many historical aspects to it, such as the ability to colonize places that, at the time, were not under any European power, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, and Northern Canada. The game's time frame is from 1836-1936."@en ;

The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was released in March 2009 to coincide with WrestleMania XXV. The game was developed by Yuke's and published by THQ, the same developer and publisher for the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw video game series. The WWE logo featured in the game was a slight modification of the pre-1990 WWF logo."@en ;

The game featured improved gameplay and grappling techniques compared to it predecessors. This game was the Game Boy Advanced successor to WWF Road to WrestleMania from 2001. The game was succeeded by WWE Survivor Series released in 2004. WWE also released WWE WrestleMania X8 for the GameCube in June 2002, making the GBA game in a way the \"prequel\", despite WrestleMania X8 being published five months prior. The controls for the game are very limited, as the hand-held Game Boy Advance platform which it is available only has space for very few buttons and devices. Also, very limited external devices can be used to add on to the already existing game features, although it does allow for four player options through direct link cables. WWE Survivor Series and WWF Road to WrestleMania were the only other versions of the WWE games developed by Natsume for the GBA and earned only average reviews from the gaming world. WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 was the most successful out of the three games in regards to both sales and reviews."@en ;

Based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), it is the sequel to WWE WrestleMania X8. The roster consists of around forty WWE wrestlers from the period between 2002 to 2003, as the WWE was beginning to shift it's momentum from the Attitude Era into what was known as the Era of Ruthless Aggression. Unlike the previous game and other contemporary WWE games, WrestleMania XIX does not feature a conventional story/career mode in which players control a particular wrestler in a series of matches. Instead, the game features \"Revenge Mode\" a mission-based mode in which players try to achieve certain goals in various locations outside of the ring. Most of the background music of the game were also in both the Xbox game WWE RAW 2 and the PlayStation 2 game, WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain THQ followed WrestleMania XIX with WWE Day of Reckoning"@en ;

Her father Vince McMahon promises to grant the player a shot at the WWF Championship if they manage to save her. The player must then fight through a series of side-scrolling levels to rescue Stephanie. The player can play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, or The Undertaker.

The game was first released in Japan on October 1, 2009 and other regions in the same month. Wii Fit Plus was originally announced during Nintendo's E3 2009 media briefing on June 2, 2009. The game is an enhanced version of Wii Fit. In addition to the original Wii Fit activities and options, Wii Fit Plus incorporates 15 new balance and aerobics games (referred to as \"Training Plus\") and six new strength training and yoga activities. New features include a calorie burning counter, the ability for users to create custom fitness regimens or choose from a number of specialized routines based on specific objectives and available time, as well as having the option to create profiles for pets and babies. Users are also able to navigate more quickly between exercises. Wii Fit Plus is sold bundled with a Wii Balance Board, as well as separately for existing Wii Balance Board owners. Most activities are for a single player, but there are a number of multi-player activities that allow for up to 8 players to take turns using one Wii Balance Board. Wii Fit Plus garnered both critical and commercial success. The game has received aggregate review scores of 80.83% and 80% on GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Wii Fit Plus is the seventh best-selling game on the Wii, with a total of 21.12 million copies sold as of March 2016."@en ;

It features the modern Japanese mahjong rules (with riichi and dora) and various characters from the Mario video-game series. The original version was released in Japan in March 2005 by Nintendo. In September of the following year they re-released the game with an online mode and the revised title Yakuman DS with Wi-Fi Support (Wi-Fi対応役満DS Wi-Fi Taiō Yakuman DS). Both versions were released only in Japan and with predominantly Japanese text. In Japanese mahjong the term yakuman can refer both to the rare high-scoring limit hands and to the largest score limit that can be applied to a winning hand under Japanese mahjong scoring rules."@en ;

The first version of Zork was written in 1977–1979 using the MDL programming language on a DEC PDP-10 computer. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group. When Zork was published commercially, it was split up into three games: Zork: The Great Underground Empire - Part I (later known as Zork I), Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz, and Zork III: The Dungeon Master. Zork distinguished itself in its genre as an especially rich game, in terms of both the quality of the storytelling and the sophistication of its text parser, which was not limited to simple verb-noun commands (\"hit troll\"), but recognized some prepositions and conjunctions (\"hit the troll with the Elvish sword\")."@en ;

Zub is in the employ of Emperor Zub of the Zub galactic empire who has been tasked with retrieving the Green Eye of Zub. In order to facilitate this task, Zub has been permitted use of the ancient intergalactic elevator system which permits transport between planets. The elevators do not follow any sort of linear route and must be reached by traversing and riding platforms on planets to reach any of the three elevators at the top of the chain. The platforms and elevators are guarded by creatures confusingly known as Zubs but each planet has a different sub-species - for example the first level's Zub resembles a gyroscope whilst he fourth level's is a fish. The Zubs can be shot and stunned. They will float to the top platform level and then descend to harass and attack Zub. The Green Eye of Zub was last located on the tenth planet and once the Eye is found, Zub has to return to the first planet to present the Eye of Zub to Emperor Zub. There are seven difficulty levels, each one increases the number of enemy Zubs per planet."@en ;

The 3DiTeams Project was conceived by Dr. Jeffrey M. Taekman and Jerry Heneghan and is managed by the Human Simulation and Patient Safety Center (HSPSC) at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina. Dr. Taekman, M.D. is an Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology and the Assistant Dean for Educational Technology within the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr Taekman also serves as chairman of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare's Serious Games / Virtual Environments Special Interest Group. Co-Principal Investigator for the project is Melanie C. Wright, Ph.D. who is an Assistant Professor human factors engineer in Anesthesiology. Additional assistance is provided by Noa Segall, Ph.D. and Gene Hobbs, C.H.T.. Recently, the Duke team received funding for the Immersive Learning Environment @ Duke (also known as ILE@D) -- an interactive virtual environment for healthcare distance education. The Virtual Heroes, Inc. team was led by the chief technical officer Randy Brown and executive producer Henry F. Schwetzke. The programming team was technical director Gerke M. Preussner, Gabriel Scott, Ed Sirko, and Jay Nakai. The design team was Troy Bowman and Steven Cattrell. The artistic team was art director Tad Irish, director of visual development Takayoshi Sato, artists Sebastian Penedo, David Jones, Andrew Allen, Heather Cerlan, and Thomas Miller. Software quality assurance was provided by manager Franklin A Crawford IV, Tony Sturtzel and Sean Sayers. The project was unveiled to the general public in a workshop entitled \"3DiTeams – Team Training in a Virtual Interactive Environment\" hosted by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Annual Meeting in San Francisco, California on October 16, 2007. Since that time, it has been the subject of presentations for the Second Annual TeamSTEPPS Consortium Meeting, the Fourth Annual Games for Health Conference, First Annual North Carolina Advanced Learning Technology Summit, and Leadership Symposium on Digital Media in Health Care."@en ;

The game was also ported by Spike to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. A version for iOS and Android was released as well in 2011. 428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de is a visual novel set in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo where the narrative is presented using a combination of scrolling text, live action stills and video sequences. The game shares many story and gameplay elements with Chunsoft's 1998 sound novel game Machi, the most prominent being the locale, Shibuya. Although Chunsoft does not openly state 428 is a sequel, the game contains numerous references to Machi, and an early marketing slogan reads \"Breaking a long silence, Shibuya gets going again.\" The game has received high praise from critics, earning a perfect score in Famitsu Weekly, Japan's largest circulating video game magazine. The game also features a special scenario contributed by Kinoko Nasu and Takashi Takeuchi of Type-Moon fame, who wrote and provided character designs for them respectively. It was subsequently announced by Sega that this particular scenario by Type-Moon would be adapted into an anime TV series titled Canaan, which began airing in Japan on July 4, 2009. A series of four novels based on the game were published by Kodansha between the months of September and December 2009."@en ;

The player does not assign citizens to their various punishments and rewards, since the game does this automatically. Instead, the player creates the infrastructure (roads, zones for the various sins/virtues, reincarnation centers) that allows the afterlife to function properly. Players are accountable for the job that they do because their bosses, The Powers That Be, check in from time to time. The player also has the assistance of two advisors—Aria Goodhalo, an angel, and Jasper Wormsworth, a demon. Aria and Jasper provide warnings when things are going wrong with the afterlife, and offer tips on how to fix the problems. The game is very satirical, with various references to pop culture (such as a passing mention of a \"San Quentin Scarearantino\" or sending a Death Star to destroy buildings if the player cheats too much)."@en .

The game uses the Genie, a 2D sprite-based game engine. The game allows the user to act as the leader of an ancient civilization by advancing it through four ages (the Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron Ages), gaining access to new and improved units with each advance. It was later ported to Pocket PCs with Windows, resulting in a version very similar to the PC game. Originally touted as Civilization meets Warcraft, some reviewers felt that the game failed to live up to these expectations when it was released. Despite this, it received generally good reviews, and an expansion pack, titled The Rise of Rome, was released in 1998. Both the original Age of Empires and the expansion pack were later released as \"The Gold Edition\". A sequel, Age of Empires II, was released in 1999."@en ;

It was developed by Zombie Studios and was published by Activision Value. The game was released worldwide on November 23, 2001 exclusively for the Microsoft Windows platform. Players control a falsely accused person as he attempts to escape five different types of prisons in order to prove his innocence in the outside world. Players have to sneak past guards in order to make it through every prison level. If seen, an alarm is rung that forces players to hide temporarily. The name of the title was kept under wraps until late in the development cycle; causing the programming team to create a makeshift Alcatraz level by inserting fog horns, seagulls and an crudely drawn Golden Gate Bridge."@en ;

The game was released on December 4, 2007 and was the first game by the short-lived video game publisher Brash Entertainment. It follows The Chipmunks as they play their way from small venues (such as a high school prom or a civic center) to massive crowds at Burning Munk and ultimately Rockathonapalooza. The soundtrack features 40 songs, including \"All the Small Things\" by Blink-182, \"It's Tricky\" by Run-D.M.C., and \"Heartbreak Hotel\" by Elvis Presley. The gameplay itself is similar to other rhythm games such as Rock Band and Guitar Hero. Jason Lee reprised his role as David Seville in the story cutscenes while Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and Janice Karman reprise their roles from the 1980s-2000s cartoons. A second installment, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, was released on December 1, 2009 to coincide with the release of the film of the same name."@en ;

It was developed by BlueSky Software and Disney Software for the MS-DOS, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and Amiga platforms. The player assumes the role of Delbert McClintock, a bug-exterminator and character from the original film, fighting to save the United States from a horde of invading killer spiders. Delbert must go through houses in eight towns, killing spiders in each one. If Delbert succeeds in finishing all eight towns, the United Nations declares that the spider must become extinct, and commissions McClintock to work with Dr. Atherton to go to South America, home of the spiders."@en ;

In the vein of interactive movie games like Wild Gunman, Dragon's Lair, and Cliff Hanger, Badlands lets its players navigate through various animated sequences by pressing a single button at a precise moment (unlike Dragon's Lair, there is no joystick). Since the game is themed as an old West shooter, the function of the button is almost always the fire the main character's gun to fend off against attackers. If the player shoots too soon, he will be hanged for murder. Failing to fire in time, however, will result in being killed by the attack. As the player progresses, the timing becomes more precise.The game was very particular about firing at the right time, which made it very difficult and often unplayable. At one point Buck must shoot a snake and fire at the snake at the exact second to succeed. It is even possible for Buck to shoot himself in sequences where it shows him. Distributed by Centuri in the U.S., it was Konami's only laserdisc game."@en .

It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. The game received critical acclaim and was credited for revitalizing the computer role-playing game genre. The game allows development of the player character through choice of companions, dialogue choices, exploration, and battle. Baldur's Gate uses a reputation system and rewards the player depending on the choices made in the game. Baldur's Gate was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics. Interplay went on to use the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the Icewind Dale series, as well as other licensed D&D campaign worlds such as Planescape, setting of Planescape: Torment. The engine was later enhanced for use in a remake of the game entitled Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, the first game in the franchise in nearly nine years."@en ;

It is the sequel to the 2001 game Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance. The game is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of Dungeons & Dragons, and the gameplay is based on the rules of Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, which were released in 2000. Dark Alliance II is a direct sequel to the original Dark Alliance game, with the story following five adventurers attempting to save Baldur's Gate from a growing evil, and ascertain the fate of the protagonists from the first game. Dark Alliance II was well received on both platforms, although many critics felt it was not much of an advancement on the first game. A sequel was planned, but was cancelled early in development due to legal problems. The use of the Dark Alliance game engine also led to a lawsuit filed by the engine's creators, Snowblind Studios, against publishers Interplay, which alleged the engine had been used in the game without Snowblind's permission."@en ;

The developers licensed the game to Epyx, who published it as Death Sword in the United States. Barbarian is a fighting game that gives players control over sword-wielding barbarians. In the game's two-player mode, players pit their characters against each other. Barbarian also has a single-player mode, in which the player's barbarian braves a series of challenges set by an evil wizard to rescue a princess. Instead of using painted artwork for the game's box, Palace Software used photos of hired models. The photos, also used in advertising campaigns, featured Michael Van Wijk (who would later become famous as 'Wolf' in the TV series Gladiators) as the hero and bikini-clad Maria Whittaker, a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid's Page Three topless photo shoots. Palace Software's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom, with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game. The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarian's profile, helping to make it a commercial success. Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat, and dashes of humour. The game was Palace Software's critical hit; boosted by Barbarian's success, Palace Software expanded its operations and started publishing other developers' work. In 1988, the company released a sequel, Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax."@en ;

The game's Frostbite 1.5 engine allows for destructible environments. Multiplayer maps, which allow for five different game modes, contain a wide selection of vehicles, aircraft and emplacements. The game was met with positive reception from critics, garnering a mean of 88 from aggregator Metacritic for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, and 87 for the PC version. It has become a commercial success, having sold more than twelve million units since its initial release. Seven VIP map packs as well as a downloadable game mode have been released thus far, plus an  centered on the Vietnam War, which was released on December 21, 2010."@en ;

Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII is the second of two expansions to the World War II first-person shooter computer game Battlefield 1942. It was released for Microsoft Windows 4 September 2003 in North America and 5 September 2003 in Europe. It was also released for OS X on 25 October 2004. Secret Weapons of WWII brings many new features to the original game, such as new weapons, vehicles, battles, factions, and a new gameplay mode that focuses on fulfilling objectives more than destroying the enemy army. These new features help to bring variety to its predecessor's gameplay without overhauling the series. For example, while an Allied engineer may still maintain his original role as being able to repair vehicles, his long-ranged rifle has been replaced with a shotgun, which is effective at short distances."@en ;

It was released in October 2013. The game features Jodie Holmes, one of two player characters. The other is an incorporeal entity named Aiden: a separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by actress Ellen Page, possesses supernatural powers through her psychic link to Aiden, growing from adolescence to adulthood while learning to control Aiden and the powers they share. Willem Dafoe co-stars as Nathan Dawkins, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and Jodie's surrogate-father-figure. The actors in the game worked during the year-long project in Quantic Dream's Paris studio to perform on-set voice acting and motion capture acting. Despite being a video game, Beyond: Two Souls premiered at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, marking only the second time the film festival recognised a video game. David Cage, writer and director of the game, explained that game development studios should provide \"interactive storytelling\" that can be played by everyone, including non-gamers. The game received polarized critical reception upon its release. Sales reached over one million copies worldwide by the end of 2013, two months after the game's release. A PlayStation 4 version was released as both a standalone title in November 2015 and in the Quantic Dream Collection with Heavy Rain, in March 2016."@en ;

The game was to use a modified version of the SPECIAL role-playing system, which had been implemented in the Fallout series. Developed on various editions of the Lithtech engine, Torn possessed features unseen in previous Black Isle Studios games, such as 3D graphics and real-time camera movement. In Torn, the player assumed the role of a wanderer, who was cursed to bring misfortune to people and places around it. Under a king's orders, the player undertook quests to clarify a series of conflicting prophecies. Unlike several other Black Isle Studios games, the game was to take place in an original world titled \"Torn\" instead of a traditional Dungeons & Dragons location."@en .

Although it uses isometric projection, as with Ultimate's second-generation isometric releases such as Nightshade and Gunfright, Bubbler used a scrolling display rather than the flip-screen of earlier titles such as Knight Lore and Alien 8. As with the contemporary Ultimate title Martianoids, Bubbler was not written by the partnership of Tim Stamper and Chris Stamper. It was instead programmed by a team at U.S. Gold, and was therefore an Ultimate game in name only. It was Ultimate's final title for 8-bit home computers. In 1988 the company became Rare, embarking on a long-running partnership with Nintendo to develop console games."@en ;

Virgin ported the game to home computer systems DOS, the Atari ST and the Archimedes, and the consoles Jaguar, Mega Drive, SNES and 3DO. The game is military-themed and based on shooting action but with a strategy game-style control system. The player directs troops through numerous missions, battling enemy infantry, vehicles and installations. Cannon Fodder has a darkly humorous tone which commentators variously praised and condemned. Its creators intended it to convey an anti-war message, which some reviewers recognised, but the Daily Star and a number of public figures derided the game. In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines. Amiga Action awarded it an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year."@en .

The PC version was released on August 27, 2013. The game is a reboot of the Castlevania series, and reveals the origins of Dracula. Set in Southern Europe during the Middle Ages, the story focuses on Gabriel Belmont and his quest to defeat a malevolent order known as the Lords of Shadow and resurrect his wife. The player controls Gabriel in 3D environments as he uses melee skills to defeat enemies and solves puzzles to move through the game. The game was originally announced as Lords of Shadow with no connection to the Castlevania series mentioned. This was done to keep their plans to radically change the direction of the Castlevania mythos a secret and to prevent the announcement of the game from upstaging another series release, Castlevania Judgment. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series, helped produce the title. The music was composed by Spanish composer Óscar Araujo, who was acclaimed for his work on the game. The game sold well and received positive reviews from video game publications. It was praised for new elements it provided to the franchise, although this was also the subject of criticism as it did not retain traits from previous Castlevania games. Konami requested that the development team produce more titles related to Lords of Shadow. This includes two sequels titled Castlevania: Lords of Shadow – Mirror of Fate and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2."@en ;

The game was produced on behalf of Nuclearvision Entertainment, and was distributed free of charge over Valve Corporation's Steam online delivery system as a promotional title for the then-upcoming Half-Life 2. The game has since been removed from Steam's storefront due to factors related to the developer's bankruptcy. The game started off as a fan project of Paul Kamma and Sönke Seidel, the concept being inspired by various Half-Life 2 advertisements. Soon after, the two started working on Codename: Gordon on behalf of Nuclearvision Entertainment. The company also presented the game to Valve, the developer team of the original Half-Life series, who later distributed the game through Steam. Codename: Gordon has been overall well received by both reviewers, and the public, the game attracting over 600,000 players in the first three weeks after its release. Reviewers appreciated the game for its gameplay and unique dialog style, but also criticized it for its improper optimization, and lack of opponent variety."@en ;

It was developed and published for the Mac OS X in September 2011 by Feral Interactive. This is the first game in the McRae series since McRae's death in 2007. It was announced on 19 November 2008 and features Ken Block, Travis Pastrana, Tanner Foust, and Dave Mirra. The game includes many new race-events, including stadium events. Along with the player, an RV travels from one event to another, and serves as \"headquarters\" for the player. It features a roster of contemporary off-road events, taking players to diverse and challenging real-world environments. The game takes place across four continents: Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The game includes five different event types: Rally, Rallycross, \"Trailblazer\", \"Land Rush\" and \"Raid\". The World Tour mode sees players competing in multi-car and solo races at new locations, and also includes a new multiplayer mode. The sequel Dirt 3 was released on 24 May 2011."@en ;

                                                    ex:HasStory "Conflict is a hex-based NES war game where the player is a commander who must lead his forces to victory. The player can earn fame points by occupying cities and airports and destroying units of the opponent's army; fame points are lost by losing units of one's army in battle or retreating from battles. The goal of each of the 16 scenarios is to destroy the enemy's flag tank. The first player controls the blue (Western Bloc) forces while the computer (or second player) controls red (Eastern Bloc) troops. Each player starts with two or three factories, at least one of which specializes in air combat units and at least one of which specializes in ground warfare units. On each turn, the player can, if he still has a factory that has not been destroyed, produce one military unit. The more fame points the player has, the more powerful units he can produce (e.g. tanks instead of infantry). The computer always starts with more fame points than the human; since this state of affairs tends to produce an increasingly overwhelming materiel advantage if left unaddressed, the goal of depleting the computer's fame points, usually by destroying powerful red Army units, tends to be a high priority at the beginning of the game. The hexagons can be plains, woods, mountains, barren terrain, shoals, seas, bridges, airports, towns, or factories. The terrain in each hexagon has an effect on maneuverability and the extent to which forces can take evasive action. Units can be repaired, refueled, and rearmed at cities or airports, depending on whether the unit is a ground or air unit. A sequel was released for the Super NES entitled Super Conflict."@en ;

It is the third console iteration of the Contra series, following the original Contra and Super C for the NES. Set in the futuristic year 2636, the alien invaders that were defeated during the previous installments have decided to launch a full-scale war against mankind on Earth, starting the \"Alien Wars\". Unlike the previous Contra games for the NES and Game Boy, the futuristic setting was kept for the American version. However, the identities of \"Bill\" and \"Lance\", the original Contra heroes, were changed to their descendants \"Jimbo\" and \"Sully\", maintaining the continuity of the previous localizations. Likewise, the alien invader was once again changed to \"Red Falcon\"."@en ;

It was released on 24 April 2001. The game has an isometric view and is set in the 17th and 18th centuries of Europe. It features sixteen playable nations each with its own architectural styles, technologies and units. Players must avoid famine and engage in army expansion, building construction and simple resource gathering. Mission scenarios range from conflicts such as Thirty Years' War to the War of the Austrian Succession, and the game is renowned for the seemingly unlimited number of units players may control. This ability set it apart from other games of the time such as Age of Empires and Empire Earth. Cossacks is a game which allows the user to gain strategy skills and even pick up some relative history of that period by the inclusion of a comprehensive encyclopedia. This top selling title has won two awards and was positively favoured by a majority of reviewers."@en ;

This game focuses exclusively on the Napoleonic era, meaning it has a much shorter time span than others in this series, which spanned several centuries. Therefore, fewer technologies can be researched than in other Cossacks games, and there aren't as many different unit types for each country as before. On the other hand, Cossacks II allows a large number of units to be trained and it has many tactical options and an updated graphical engine."@en ;

Released in 1996, it is a reworked and extended version of the original Daytona USA, and was developed by the same developer that oversaw the mostly arcade-perfect Saturn port of Sega Rally Championship, by using a modified version of the Sega Saturn engine of Sega Rally Championship. This version was originally released in Europe and North America (with some modifications done in the subsequent Japanese release), and drastically reduced the popup that was prevalent in the original Sega Saturn version of Daytona USA. With the increased framerate (now a solid thirty frames per second) came a new selection of cars, two new courses and a 2-player mode. Daytona USA: CCE is compatible with the Saturn's 3D analogue control pad, in addition to the Arcade Racer steering wheel and the Virtua Stick accessories. The European release is notable as the game did not feature the \"black bars\" at the top and bottom of the screen that are usually associated with the majority of PAL games of the era - the box even boasts \"slick new full screen graphics\". The game also sported a soundtrack by Richard Jacques and Jun Senoue which, while featuring remixes of the original tunes and several new ones, did not feature the original tunes themselves. It was also separately released for the Saturn as a Netlink-compatible title, entitled Daytona USA: CCE Netlink Edition. Although the accolade is commonly ascribed to Panzer Dragoon Saga, this NetLink version of Daytona USA: CCE is in fact the rarest North American Sega Saturn game. It was available only through Sega's online store, and making it even more rare is its almost total lack of distinguishability from the regular version of Daytona USA: CCE: the only notable differences are the additions of a black-and-white NetLink booklet with the standard booklet and a small NetLink logo on the game disc. This edition fetches up to US $1,900 (August 2013) on eBay, in the rare instances it does pop up. The game retained the \"Dancing Jeffry\" feature from the Seaside Street Galaxy from the original Daytona USA. Jeffry is actually one of the main characters from Virtua Fighter, but a statue of him was created in the course as a secondary feature. Just like the original Daytona USA, you have to press X while being in front of Jeffry to make him dance."@en ;

One of the highest grossing arcade games of all time, Daytona USA was Sega's first title to debut on the Sega Model 2 arcade board, and, at the time of its release, was considered the most visually detailed 3D racing game. Compared to the flat-shaded polygons of its predecessor, Virtua Racing, Daytona's 3D-world was fully texture-mapped, giving it a more realistic appearance. Daytona was one of the first video games to feature filtered, texture-mapped polygons, giving it the most detailed graphics yet seen in a video game up until that time. In single-player mode, Daytona maintained a consistent 60fps (frames per second) rate, even with multiple opponents on screen, surpassing the motion smoothness of the only other racing game in a comparable graphical arena, Namco's Ridge Racer. A slightly updated version of Daytona USA was re-released in arcades in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic. On 12 October 2011 Sega announced that Daytona USA would be coming to Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. This also marked the return of the original name. The game saw its release on 25 October for PlayStation Network, and 26 October for Xbox Live Arcade."@en ;

It was programmed by Stavros Fasoulas and the music was written by Rob Hubbard. The menu-music is based on the theme of Koyaanisqatsi by Philip Glass and the in-game-music is based on Pink Floyd's On the Run. The game was also released for the ZX Spectrum in 1990 as Delta Charge. The game was released as Delta Patrol in the United States by Electronic Arts for its Amazing Software line of action-oriented software programs, in 1987 on the Commodore 64. The player controls a spaceship and gains power-up points by destroying formations of enemies. Some enemy formations instead subtract power-up points for the player, so the player must take note of which formations to destroy. Periodically blocks containing the power-ups (higher speed, faster rate of fire) appear and the player can pick one of them up: The more points the player has collected, the more powerful are the power-ups that can be chosen. Unavailable power-ups are gray and kill the player if he flies into them, making them part of the obstacles in the game. The effects of the power-ups are lost over time and must therefore be regained. The player gets a choice between in-game music or in-game sound effects. There is also a high score table but no way to save it when the game is turned off. The game title music was covered by Desert Planet in their 2003 album Joystick Pop."@en ;

Acclaim Entertainment published the 16-bit version, which features run and gun gameplay, for the Super NES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD. Virgin Interactive released a completely different game for the 3DO that combined several distinct gameplay styles. In both games, the player controls John Spartan, the main character from the film, as he attempts to find and defeat his nemesis, Simon Phoenix."@en ;

The game is a high-definition remake of DuckTales, a game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. It was released for multiple gaming platforms, including the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and the Wii U, over a three-month period between August and November 2013, and later expanded to iOS, Android, and Windows Phone in April 2015. The game features a 2.5D presentation with 2D hand-drawn character sprites and 3D modeled levels. Like the original version, the game focuses on Scrooge McDuck traveling across the world in search of five treasures to further increase his fortune. Remastered took one and a half years to make, being developed in late 2011, and features vast enhancements to the original graphics and audio, an expanded storyline, and a full voice cast that includes the original animated series' then-surviving voice actors and actresses. Remastered received generally positive reviews. Individual versions of the game were reviewed by GameRankings with scores of 71.22% to 75.07%, and by Metacritic with scores of 66 to 76 out of 100. Reviewers have praised the game for its gameplay and presentation while criticizing the overabundance of story content."@en ;

The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher. Eat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a \"legendary\" gaming hero who is \"returning to glory\" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious \"comeback\" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley. The game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles. The cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"."@en ;

It was developed by Monster Games, is the fourth main game in the Excite series and is the sequel to Excite Truck. Excitebots was unveiled in a release list from Nintendo of America on February 26, 2009. It was released on April 20, 2009 in North America. Excitebots features animal-themed robot vehicles and short minigames during racing, such as pie throwing, bowling and soccer. The game could be bought packaged with or without the Wii Wheel. Despite a positive reception from critics, the game was never released outside North America. Nintendo Australia's Managing Director, Rose Lappin has said that Excitebots will not be seeing an Australian release \"due to lack of interest.\" However, Japanese Club Nintendo members were able to exchange points for a copy starting from over two years of the original release date."@en ;

The game is an officially licensed product of the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals held in Germany. FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup World Cup mode only includes UEFA qualification groups for the 2006 World Cup. Released in 2005, this was the first FIFA game for a 7th Generation console. Road to FIFA World Cup is an Xbox 360 exclusive and preceded the release of 2006 FIFA World Cup game on the PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and other consoles by several months. It offers superior graphics to previous versions, though at the expense of many gameplay features. For the first time in the FIFA series, it allows the player to practise shooting against the goalkeeper while each match is loading."@en ;

The game is part of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series. The game follows the Darklord as she defends her mobile tower from waves of attacks as it travels across the kingdom. Unlike most tower defense games the game is played from a side view of the tower, as the player places units and traps to attempt to prevent enemies from reaching the top of the tower and the Dark Crystal kept there. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics generally praising the game's gameplay and presentation while critiquing a perceived lack of depth to the game."@en ;

The app was a number one bestseller on the App Store in 19 countries simultaneously on April 6, 2009 and has sold over 3.8 million copies. The development and publishing of Flight Control on non-Apple mobile phones is being handled by Namco under license. An HD version of the game called Flight Control HD was released for the iPad in March 2010 and for the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Network (supporting the PlayStation Move controller) on September 15, 2010. The PlayStation 3 version supports exclusive additional features including a stereoscopic 3D mode, 1080p resolution, four player co-operative multiplayer, as well as an exclusive new map, Metropolis, which features a day and night cycle. Flight Control HD was also ported to the Microsoft Windows and OS X operating systems and made available through Steam. These releases are similar to the iPad version aside from the addition of a new airfield. The Mac version was released via the Mac App Store on July 21, 2011. In September 2015, the iOS version was removed for sale from the App Store, although it remains for sale on Android."@en ;

It was one of the first racing games to feature a career mode, multiple vehicles and an opportunity for the player to increase the performance of their in-game car through car tuning, which were unique elements for a racer of the NES era and a genre only truly revisited during the fifth generation of game consoles where games such as Gran Turismo became popular. Races start out as single-lap events but become double-lap events as the player starts racing against more experienced competition in places like Las Vegas, Nevada and Hawaii. With gameplay similar to Rad Racer and Pole Position, the driver races towards the back of the screen. The names of the opponents are chosen partially at random; they can also vary because of the ranking level of the course and the type of vehicle used. Like in Rad Racer, the player can supercharge an automobile to go up to 255 miles per hour or 410 kilometres per hour."@en .

It was originally planned to be released in mid-2002, but was delayed to November due to avoid clashing with the release of EA Sports F1 2002 in June. This game made the in-game debut of James Allen who had taken over the commentary duties from Murray Walker on the ITV coverage. Walker was also featured, doing commentary in the arcade mode. This was Walker's last Formula 1 game appearance, until he performed introductory voice-over on the \"F1 Classics\" mode in Codemasters' F1 2013. First issues of this game came with a DVD of the 2001 season that was not commercially released which featured multi-angles and footage from the defunct F1 Digital, a pay-per-view service which allowed the purchaser access to multiple camera shots, sessions and a choice to follow cars as the sessions progressed. The main menu music featured the song \"Psynn 2\" by Shawn Hargreaves. This was the first ever Formula One game featuring the Launch Control despite the system being introduced prior to 2001 Spanish Grand Prix."@en ;

It was developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Hasbro Interactive in November 1997. The game is an expansion of the original arcade game, sporting levels with large maps, an updated set of graphics rendered in 3D, and additional gameplay moves. Critical reaction was mixed, with frequent criticism towards the gameplay, controls, and difficulty; while the graphics were received positively. Despite the mixed reception from critics, it was a commercial success, with the PlayStation version going on to become one of the best-selling titles for the console. In 2000 Frogger was followed by Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge, which builds on the gameplay elements found in this game. The sequel was given an E rating as opposed to the pre-1998 K-A rating."@en ;

The game was not released in Japan. A prototype of the game was developed by n-Space, who approached Nintendo to be the game's publisher. Nintendo accepted, making Geist the second GameCube game published by Nintendo to receive an M-rating (the first being Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem). In the following years, Nintendo and n-Space worked closely on Geist. The game was first shown at the E3 2003 and was announced to be part of the GameCube's line-up for 2003. However, it was delayed multiple times, making it two years of delay for fine-tuning. During that time, the game's genre changed from first-person shooter to first-person action-adventure with second-person elements. The Geist franchise is owned by Nintendo, due to their contract with n-Space."@en ;

Released for mobile phones supporting the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) on June 20, 2007, it is the third installment in the God of War series, and the fifth chronologically. Loosely based on Greek mythology, Betrayal is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist Kratos, who became the new God of War after killing the former, Ares. Kratos is framed for the murder of Argos and pursues the true assassin across Greece, resulting in a confrontation with Olympian messenger Ceryx. Betrayal is the only installment in the series to be released on a non-PlayStation platform and presented as a 2D side-scrolling game. Despite the limitations of the mobile platform, in comparison to its home console counterparts, it retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the same combination of combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Although God of War is primarily a home console series, Betrayal was praised for its fidelity to the series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics: \"the real deal third game in the killer franchise\". It received awards for \"Wireless Game of the Month\" (June 2007) and \"Best Platform Game\" (wireless) of 2007."@en ;

The game was released in North America on the PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 on March 29, 2009 and on PlayStation 2 on April 14, 2009, with an Australian and European release in May 2009. Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game of the Guitar Hero series to focus on the career and songs of one band following Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. The game is based on Guitar Hero World Tour, with support for lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game has many of the same features from World Tour, including single-player and band Career modes, online competitive modes, and the ability to create and share songs through \"GHTunes\". In addition to the normal difficulty levels presented in Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero: Metallica provides an \"Expert+\" difficulty for drums that allows the use of a second bass drum pedal to match the drumming style of Metallica's Lars Ulrich. The game features 28 master recordings spanning Metallica's career and an additional 21 songs selected by members of Metallica. The band performed extensive motion capture for the game for their in-game avatars and performances. The game includes several extras including behind-the-scenes videos of the motion capture sessions, tour and concert videos of the band, and Pop-Up Video-like facts for many of the songs on the game disc. Guitar Hero: Metallica received positive reviews, with critics stating it to be a strong tribute to the band and Neversoft's best work on the Guitar Hero series to date. The difficulty throughout the game was praised, found to be more enjoyable to players of all skill levels than the more-difficult Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Reviewers noted the lack of additional downloadable content, save for the pre-existing Death Magnetic songs, the cartoonish storyline for the Career mode, and the overall value of the game as some of the negatives to the experience."@en ;

As with the previous games Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and Guitar Hero: Metallica, the game features 25 songs from Van Halen along with 19 additional songs from selected artists that have been inspired by the group. The game was released in retail for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii systems on December 22, 2009, in North America, and in February 2010 for PAL regions. However, as part of a promotion with Guitar Hero 5, the game was shipped to Guitar Hero 5 purchasers in North America prior to its retail release. The game was developed by Neversoft with Underground Development assisting Neversoft on developing the Xbox 360 port and published by Activision. The game has received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of which consider the game's quality to be greatly inferior to its predecessor, Guitar Hero: Metallica and other games of the series. The reviewers criticized the lack of former Van Halen members, Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony and Gary Cherone, the limited tracks selected from Van Halen's discography, the selection of other tracks included in the game, and the general lack of features introduced in the previous band-centric games and Guitar Hero 5."@en ;

The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 3 June 2013, and soon followed with versions for OS X and Linux. The game is set in the near future and sees players assume the role of freelance spy Richard Conway, who is tasked with infiltrating buildings to fulfil assignments from various clients. To do so, the player must avoid guards and bypass security features with the aid of a number of high-tech gadgets, such as the Crosslink tool which is used to rewire electrical circuits. Throughout the game, Conway seeks to clear his name in the murder of a high-profile weapons manufacturer, and gradually uncovers a murder mystery in his search for the real killer."@en ;

It was Valve's debut product and the first in the Half-Life series. Players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, who must fight his way out of a secret research facility after a teleportation experiment goes disastrously wrong, fighting enemies and solving puzzles. Unlike many other games at the time, Half-Life features no cutscenes; the player has uninterrupted control of Freeman, and the story is told through scripted sequences seen through his eyes. Valve co-founder Gabe Newell said the team had wanted to create an immersive world rather than a \"shooting gallery\". The game's engine, GoldSrc, is a heavily modified version of the Quake engine licensed from id Software. Half-Life received acclaim for its graphics, realistic gameplay, and seamless narrative. It won over fifty PC \"Game of the Year\" awards and is often considered one of the greatest games of all time. It influenced first-person shooters for years after its release; according to IGN, the history of the genre \"breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-Half-Life and post-Half-Life eras.\" Half-Life had sold eight million copies by November 16, 2004, and 9.3 million copies by December 2008. It was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001, and OS X and Linux in 2013. It was followed in 2004 by a sequel, Half-Life 2."@en ;

Part of the Halo series, the game was released on October 27, 2015. Halo 5's plot follows two fireteams of human supersoldiers; when Blue Team, led by Master Chief, goes absent without leave to track down the artificial intelligence construct Cortana, the Master Chief's loyalties are called into question and Spartan Locke along with Fireteam Osiris are sent to retrieve him. 343 Industries started to formulate concepts and objectives for Halo 5 shortly after the release of its predecessor. In late 2012, the team set out goals for the game, including larger campaign and multiplayer areas. Microsoft announced Halo 5 for the Xbox One at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013. Halo 5 features a game engine that dynamically scales its resolution in order to maintain a frame rate of 60 frames per second. Upon release, Halo 5: Guardians received positive reviews from critics, with praise being directed at its gameplay, visuals, level design and multiplayer modes. The game's single-player campaign was met with divided responses, with criticism directed at its length and writing. A commercial success, Halo 5: Guardians and its game-related hardware grossed over US$400 million in its first twenty-four hours and US$500 million in its first week."@en ;

It was completely remade in 2003 for the PC, Mac and Linux by Retrospec. The working title for the game was Foot and Mouth. Visually, Head Over Heels bears a number of similarities to Ultimate Play The Game's Knight Lore and Alien 8. It uses an isometric engine that is similar to the Filmation technique first developed by Ultimate. Head Over Heels is the second isometric game by Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummond, after their earlier Batman computer game released in 1986. In 1994 another isometric video game by Ritman and Drummond, Monster Max, was released for the Nintendo Game Boy."@en .

It was originally launched by ITE Media in Denmark as Hugo Vulkanøen in January 1999, and was promptly licensed and broadcast in many other countries. In this scenario, the evil nemesis of the friendly troll Hugo, the witch Scylla (Afskylia in the original Danish version), has returned and moved to a jungle island where she teamed up with the local tyrant Don Croco. Scylla once again kidnapped Hugo's wife Hugolina and the children, but this time she keeps them captive in a cage in her new lair, located at a top of volcano in the center of the island. The players control Hugo, aided by the monkey Jean Paul and the toucan Ferdinand, as he needs to complete a series minigames (\"hugocopter\", ostrich jockey ride, liana climbing, volcano lava chase, etc.) to reach and defeat the witch and free his family."@en ;

As with previous installments of the PC series IL-2 Sturmovik, it depicts combat aircraft from World War II, although with less focus on realistic simulation than other entries in the series. The game has a campaign mode in which players are able to fly the Allies against the Axis, and also a multiplayer mode in which they are able to select either faction. A demo of the game launched on the PSN and Xbox 360's Xbox Live on 29 July 2009. Birds of Prey is based around the large-scale aerial combat and ground military operations of World War II. Players can participate in some of the war’s most famous battles, piloting fighters, attack aircraft and heavy bombers across a range of missions. There are six theatres of war to engage in: Battle of Britain, Stalingrad, Berlin, Sicily, Korsun and the Battle of the Bulge, representing the main airborne battles of World War II in Europe. Birds of Prey has a new damage effects engine. Players can see real-time damage to the aircraft such as holes in the wings and trail lines during dog fights. IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey features hundreds of aircraft taking part in air battles. The environmental engine also produces high-detail, realistic landscapes that allow players to easily see ground support actions. The game was developed by Gaijin Entertainment, who subsequently developed Birds of Steel, also exclusively for consoles. Birds of Steel shares many traits with Birds of Prey (including HUD, aircraft models, controls, and menu design) but differentiates itself by concentrating primarily on US–Japanese aerial battles of the Pacific theater."@en ;

The game was released exclusively for Wii on 17 November 2009 in North America, 26 November 2009 in Australia, and 27 November 2009 in Europe. Expanding upon a concept introduced in a minigame for Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party, players mimic the motions of an on-screen dancer's choreography for a selected song, using the Wii Remote to judge the player's motions and accuracy (eschewing accessories such as physical dance pads). Just Dance was released to mixed reviews, with criticism directed towards its simplistic gameplay, poor motion detection, and a lack of progression or additional content beyond what was included on-disc. At the same time, the simplistic gameplay of Just Dance was praised for making the game more accessible to a casual audience, and was also praised for featuring a \"fun\" soundtrack and dance routines, and for becoming more enjoyable when played as a multiplayer party game rather than alone. Just Dance was a major commercial success, selling over 4.3 million copies worldwide. and establishing a franchise that, as of October 2013, had collectively sold over 40 million units, making it Ubisoft's second-largest franchise."@en ;

The game simulates a trombone based on a traditional Chinese leaf instrument, similar to a slide whistle. In the game players can play the Leaf trombone along to a variety of tunes, as well as compose and publish songs of their own for anyone to play. Along with a \"Free Play\" mode, the \"World Stage\" feature provides a venue where players can perform their songs live for a global audience and receive ratings on a 1 to 10 scale from three separate judges. Following each performance, a player's rating is added to their previous ratings creating a comprehensive score reflecting the player's skill within the online community. The creators at Smule claim that Leaf Trombone: World Stage is \"an instrument, a game, and a huge global social experience.\""@en ;

It was released in November 2013 for Japan and February 2014 for North America, Australia and Europe. A port to Microsoft Windows through Steam was released in December 2015 followed by iOS and Android in Japan on February 17, 2016. The game is a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XIII-2, concludes the storyline of Final Fantasy XIII, and forms part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. Lightning Returns employs a highly revamped version of the gameplay system from the previous two games, with an action-oriented battle system, the ability to customize the player character's outfits, and a time limit the player must extend by completing story missions and side quests. The game's story takes place five hundred years after the previous game's ending. Lightning, the main protagonist of the first game and a key character in the second, awakes from a self-imposed hibernation 13 days before the world's end, and is chosen by the deity Bhunivelze to save the people of the dying world, including former friends and allies who have developed heavy emotional burdens. As she travels, she learns the full truth behind both the world's fate and Bhunivelze's true agenda. Development of the game started in May 2012, shortly after the release of XIII-2's final piece of DLC, and was unveiled at a special 25th Anniversary Event for the Final Fantasy series in September that year. Most of the previous games' key creative minds and developers returned, and it was developed by Square Enix's First Production Department, with developer tri-Ace helping with the graphics. The development team wanted the game to bring a conclusive end to the story of both Lightning and the XIII universe, and to address criticisms leveled against the last two games. During its first week on sale in Japan, it sold 277,000 units, and by the end of 2013 become the 17th best-selling game of the year selling over 400,000 copies. It has sold 800,000 copies as of May 2014. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the Final Fantasy XIII series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. The Windows PC version has sold over 200,000 copies according to SteamSpy. It has received mixed reviews: while the main praise went to the game's battle system, opinions were more mixed for the graphics, time limit and other aspects of gameplay, while the story and characters were criticized for being weak or poorly developed."@en ;

The cabinet features two positional guns, and a design which allows the player(s) to sit down while playing the game. It was first released in arcades in 1989 before being converted to home computers and published by U.S. Gold in 1990. It was released on the Sega Master System in 1991; however, the style of the game was changed to that of an overhead scrolling shooter. It follows a two-man commando unit as they try to escape from a terrorist facility after seizing a prototype weapon. The arcade game was praised for its graphics but criticised for lacking drama, and the home computer versions were criticized for \"blocky\" visuals, though reviewers found that there were some nice touches. The Sega Master System version was seen as disappointing."@en .

The game was first released in Japan on March 20, 2013, and in most other major regions later that same month. It is the third Mario game where Luigi is the protagonist, after Mario Is Missing and the original Luigi's Mansion. In Dark Moon, the player takes control of the Mario franchise character Luigi, who is equipped with the Poltergust 5000, a specialized vacuum cleaner used to capture ghosts. In the game's single-player mode, the main goal is to retrieve the pieces of the shattered Dark Moon, a magical object that has a pacifying effect on the ghosts residing in the game's setting, Evershade Valley, by seeking out the shards in the five haunted mansions located therein. Dark Moon offers a cooperative multiplayer mode that can be played locally or online via Nintendo Network."@en ;

It is part of the Metroid series, and was released in North America on August 31, 2010. This was shortly followed by the release in Japan, Australia and Europe in September 2010. The game is set between the events of Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. The player assumes the role of bounty hunter Samus Aran, who investigates a derelict space station along with a Galactic Federation platoon, which includes her former commanding officer, Adam Malkovich. Other M is played from a third-person perspective using only the Wii Remote, and focuses on exploration and combat. The game introduces melee attacks which could only be executed when an enemy's health was reduced to a certain degree. Impressed with the 2004 action game Ninja Gaiden, series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto approached Team Ninja to develop Other M, while D-Rockets was brought in to handle the in-game cutscenes. The development team employed a simple control scheme to make the game more intuitive and attractive, and gave significant focus on plot and characterization, with extensive usage of cinematics and voice acting. Upon release, Other M received favorable reviews, with much praise to its gameplay, music, graphics and overall atmosphere. Some journalists, however, criticized its plot and Samus' characterization in the game, which was considered negative deviation from the series' norm. The game also received honors and distinctions from several journalistic sites and magazines, including Entertainment Weekly, Game Informer, Wired, GameTrailers, and IGN. Other M was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release, and the ninth best-selling game in North America during September 2010. The game's long-term sales numbers were far below Nintendo's expectations, as a half a million copies were sold in North America by November 2010. Other M was re-released in Japan and Europe on the Wii U's Nintendo eShop in March 2016."@en ;

It is a sharply detailed dungeon crawler similar to many other role-playing video games and adventure games. The game distinguished itself from other games of its time by including a multiplayer mode that functioned over the AppleTalk protocol or Point-to-Point Protocol. A single-player exploration mode was also available, however this mode had no end goal and was useful only to discover how the various items found in the maze operated. The game's tagline was \"Kill your enemies. Kill your friends' enemies. Kill your friends.\" This tagline has reappeared as a description in the multiplayer menu screens for some of Bungie's other games, such as Myth: The Fallen Lords and Halo 3. Bungie later licensed Minotaur's game engine to the studio Paranoid Productions (Richard Rouse) who used it to create the single-player CRPG Odyssey: The Legend of Nemesis, released in 1996."@en ;

The game is based on the film of the same name. Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4; the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children's films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites, including Play magazine and GameZone. As a bonus feature, the full version of Thou Art Dead, the arcade game played in the film by Jon Heder's character, Skull (who is voiced by Keith Ferguson in this game), was included on the game disc. Thou Art Dead was an original platformer, reminiscent of both Castlevania and the Ghosts 'n Goblins series. An Xbox version of the game was planned, but it was later cancelled due to the poor sales of the system."@en ;

It is a reboot of the franchise and was developed by NetherRealm Studios and published exclusively by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems in April 2011, and a PlayStation Vita port was released in May 2012. An expanded version of the game, titled Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition, was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in February 2012 and for Microsoft Windows in July 2013. Although beginning during the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, the plot is a retcon to the earliest period in the Mortal Kombat series, the trilogy of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3. The storyline involves the divine protector of Earth, Raiden, attempting to change the aftermath of the events of Armageddon by contacting his past self as he faces defeat at the hands of the evil emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn. While having characters and levels rendered in three-dimensions, the gameplay distances itself from the fully 3D graphics one seen in the last four games, bearing closer resemblance to that of the 2D era of the series, using a camera that is perpendicular to the two-dimensional playing field. Upon release, Mortal Kombat received very positive reviews and won several awards for fighting game of the year. It was also a commercial success, selling more than two million copies in the first month alone. Due to its extremely violent content, the game was banned in Australia due to the lack of appropriate ratings category, and South Korea, and it has been reportedly indexed in Germany; the Australian ban was later lifted due to the introduction of an R18 classification and the game was released with many other R rated games in May 2014. Mortal Kombat was followed by the sequel Mortal Kombat X in 2015."@en ;

The game design is similar to Pac-Man, replacing Pac-Man with a mouse, the dots with cheese, the ghosts with cats, and the power pills with bones. The unique element of Mouse Trap is that color-coded doors in the maze can be toggled by pressing a button of the same color. The game was ported by Coleco as a ColecoVision launch title in 1982, then later to the Intellivision and Atari 2600."@en ;

It originated from the creation of TNT Team's 1997 total conversion mod for Duke Nukem 3D titled Platoon. It was picked up by Infogrames, who put them to work on a remake with more professional art and some custom source code modifications by Matt Saettler, product manager for Blood, which resulted in NAM. The game was released on July 31, 1998. U.S. Marine Sergeant Dan Snyder, who helped pioneer computer simulation training for American troops with a Doom army mod, was a consultant on the project. NAM was later re-released on Steam on November 6, 2014, with Retroism and Night Dive Studios as the publishers. The direct sequel, World War II GI, was released on March 15, 1999, again developed by TNT Team and published by GT Interactive Software."@en ;

It was one of the first ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism of the arcade game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat \"Mr. Big\". It was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics coin-op division, after being acquired by Midway. Narc was ported to the Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC home computers by Ocean Software in 1990. Narc was ported to the NES in 1990 by Rare. In 2005, the franchise was re-launched with a brand new game for the Xbox and PS2."@en .

Pac-Man (ハロー! パックマン), is a side-scrolling adventure game \"sequel\" to Pac-Man. Instead of being a maze game like the majority of its predecessors, Pac-Man 2 incorporates light point-and-click adventure game elements. It was produced and published by Namco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis systems, and was released on April 6, 1994 by Namco. The game borrows its structure and certain elements from Pac-Land, and also appears to contain certain elements from the animated series, such as Pac-Man's family and a main villain commanding the ghosts. The SNES version of Pac-Man 2 was re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2015."@en ;

The game stars the comedy-magician duo Penn & Teller. The game is composed of several minigames and an adventure/platform game starring Penn & Teller. All the minigames, with one exception, were made for the sole purpose of enabling the owner of the game to fool their friends by many different means, designating the games \"scam minigames\" and virtual tricks. Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors is unofficially the video game equivalent of Penn & Teller's Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends video, which has the same purpose, and uses properties of the video medium itself for the tricks."@en .

The player controls six characters which are supposed to save the realm they live in from an evil being which is slowly materialising into their dimension. The character races are rather unusual in RPGs and include Bionecrons, Symbions and various cross-breeds between humans, animals and mechanical entities. The gameplay concerns juggling through the set of screens which are responsible for different parts of the game, such as exploring the dungeon and a world map, inventory management, spell creation (very sophisticated runic system), network connections (used also for conversation purposes) and battle mode (a bit archaic, turn-based system). Everything is controlled from a set of icons. The game has 16-bit graphics which are mostly in grey and orange shades. The sound and music are conducted with attention to details, and the music changes depending on the action on the screen."@en ;

The game was released in North America on February 3, 2009, while its United Kingdom release was on March 23. The Australian release came later on September 23, 2009. The game is the first Phineas and Ferb video game and the first to be released for the Nintendo DS. The game's basic plot is similar to the show, as the player controls Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher as they take part in several schemes and adventures for their summer vacation. The two as well attempt to avoid their sister Candace, who is persistent in trying to \"bust\" them. Mini games are scattered throughout the game, building up the side foundation. The game was not affiliated with the creators of the show itself, Dan Povenmire and Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh. The two had little to no information on it until its release. Candace makes an appearance in the game. She is unable to \"bust\" the boys if the player enters X, Y, L, R, followed by select and is designated by a chime. Phineas and Ferb hide from her to avoid getting busted by jumping on the other's shoulders. This also allows them to interact with other, normally unavailable objects. The controls of the game are simple, basic keys normal for most DS games. To move, the player uses the control pad, while the \"A\" and \"B\" buttons are used to jump and run. The game's final segment takes place on a track where the boys race on their roller coaster. This particular scenario allows for a turbo boost by use of the \"R\" button. The game as well features an in-between mini game, featuring Perry the Platypus fighting and foiling the evil plans of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, an evil mad scientist."@en ;

However, the game also pokes fun at the conventions of these games (particularly Super Mario Bros.), featuring a crude sense of humor and frequent references to the fourth wall."@en ;

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a third-person action-adventure puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Ubisoft. First revealed in March 2003, it was released across PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows in November 2003. The Sands of Time is a reboot of the Prince of Persia series, created by Jordan Mechner. Mechner served as creative consultant, designer, and scenario writer for The Sands of Time. The game follows an unnamed Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's city at the instigation of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands as a gift to the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies. Concept work began in spring of 2001, after Ubisoft acquired the Prince of Persia catalog. After Mechner was brought on board, production began in June of that year. After the initial story draft was scrapped as it was too complex, the team began with four guiding concepts, including the ability to rewind time: this idea grew into the Dagger, the Sands, and the various powers related to them. Mechner's script drew inspiration from the Shahnameh, with the main focus on creating a simple narrative that worked with the pace of gameplay. The game used Ubisoft's Jade engine, originally designed for Beyond Good & Evil, another game published by the company. Production was troubled, with the team facing problems with the engine structure and delays with environment assets, while also managing to create an effective tester network to seek out the game's bugs. In 2004, a version for mobile phones was developed and published in North America by Gameloft. Upon release, it received critical acclaim, won and was nominated for numerous awards, and has been recognized by many as one of the greatest games of all time. Sales of the title were initially slow, but it eventually became a commercial success. Its success prompted the development of a sequel, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within, which was released in November 2004. Further games set in the Sands of Time continuity have been developed, and it is generally cited as the reason for the Prince of Persia series' return to fame."@en ;

The player commands a spaceship from a first-person perspective in real-time capable of traveling to the various planets in the game world and launching an explorer vessel to traverse their surfaces. Several sentient alien races inhabit the region with whom the player interacts through friendly conversation, intense spaceship combat, or barter at their planetary trading posts. One of these races, the Skeetch, is aggressively threatening to conquer the Earth; the player has been recruited to convince the other sentient races in the region to join humanity in an alliance against the Skeetch. A secondary goal of the game is to earn money by performing actions such as selling alien lifeforms and minerals collected on planetary surfaces to obtain the funds needed to upgrade the player's spaceship and improve the odds of survival in confrontations with the Skeetch and other hostile entities. Computer Gaming World criticized the game for failing to break new ground and for its \"muddled\" blend of science fiction themes, but did recommend it to players new to this genre. The game's working title during the first six months of development was Starflight 3 as it was originally intended to be a sequel to Starflight and Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula. The released game no longer retains a relationship to the Starflight game world because Tsunami Media's collaboration with Electronic Arts, the Starflight copyright owner, did not work out. However, the basic framework of exploration, diplomacy, trade, combat, and spaceship upgrades still bears strong resemblances to the Starflight games. A sequel, Protostar 2, was planned but never released."@en ;

The arcade version was licensed to Romstar for North American manufacturing and distribution. The game is subtitled \"The Story of Bubble Bobble 2\" and is the sequel to Taito's hit game Bubble Bobble from the previous year. It is the second of four arcade games in the Bubble Bobble series (followed by Bubble Symphony and Bubble Memories, but itself has two direct sequels: Parasol Stars and Bubble Bobble Part 2). The game was ported for numerous home computers and game consoles. The main characters are Bubblun and Bobblun, the protagonists of Bubble Bobble (known as \"Bub and Bob\" in the western releases). However, in this game they appear in their human forms as \"Bubby\" and \"Bobby\", as opposed to the \"bubble dragons\" of the first game (following on from the first game's true ending). Also unlike the first game, players must now \"alternate\" (i.e., take turns), with player one as Bubby (green shirt), and player 2 as Bobby (blue shirt) (the same color scheme as in the first game)."@en .

It is a remake of the 1996 game Resident Evil, the first installment in the Resident Evil video game series. The story takes place in 1998 near the fictional Midwestern town of Raccoon City where a series of bizarre murders have taken place. The player takes on the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, S.T.A.R.S. agents sent in by the city to investigate the murders. Resident Evil was developed over the course of one year and two months as part of an exclusivity deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring the game closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics were vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game. Upon release, Resident Evil received critical acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its graphics and improved gameplay over the original game. It is often described as one of the best, scariest, and most visually impressive entries in the Resident Evil series. Despite this, the game sold worse than expected and led Capcom to change the direction of the series to a more action-oriented approach. In 2008, the game was ported to the Wii, featuring a new control system. A high-definition version of the game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in 2015 to positive critical reception and commercial success."@en ;

It was originally published in English by Got Game Entertainment and Lighthouse Interactive. However, following the financial collapse of Lighthouse Interactive early in 2009, all European rights reverted to Arberth Studios. The developer then converted itself into a publisher and began selling the English game directly. In May 2009, Arberth dispensed with the services of Got Game Entertainment following months of declining stock availability in Got Game's North American Territory and a failure of Got Game to pay expected royalties. In August 2010, Arberth was still pursuing Got Game Entertainment for unpaid royalties. Arberth has since released a German version of the game. A Russian version appeared in 2009, translated and distributed by Logrus. In mid-2009, a group of French and Belgian enthusiasts known as Les Rhemystes completed the French translation and a download-only release followed in the Autumn, again published by Arberth Studios. Italian gaming site Puntaeclicca.com enabled the Italian download-only release in 2010. The game is set on the Celtic fringes of Britain; a place where myth and magic spill into reality, threatening the sanity of a teenage girl named Rhiannon. An ancient battle for revenge engulfs Ty Pryderi, the remote Welsh farmstead Rhiannon now calls home. She begins to hear unexplained noises, see disturbing visions, and experience other chilling paranormal phenomena. There is an ancient evil lurking in the walls of Ty Pryderi that holds a terrible connection to a timeless struggle between man and magic fabled in the Mabinogion Legends. Her parents take Rhiannon away, leaving Ty Pryderi to your watch and exploration, but their absence can only postpone the inevitability of revenge and death. In August 2009 the developers appealed for volunteers to translate the game into the Welsh language."@en ;

It is a shoot 'em up with two-dimensional graphics. The game is set in the year 2084 in a fictional world where robots have turned against humans in a cybernetic revolt. The aim is to defeat endless waves of robots, rescue surviving humans, and earn as many points as possible. Robotron popularized the twin joystick control scheme, one that had previously been used in Taito's Space Dungeon. Robotron: 2084 was critically and commercially successful. Praise among critics focused on the game's intense action and control scheme. The game is frequently listed as one of Jarvis's best contributions to the video game industry. Robotron: 2084 arcade cabinets have since become a sought-after collector's item. It was ported to numerous platforms."@en ;

                                                ex:HasStory "Rust is a multiplayer-only survival video game in development by Facepunch Studios for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. Rust was originally released onto Steam's Early Access program on 11 December 2013. Rust was initially created as a clone of DayZ, a popular mod for ARMA 2 with the addition of crafting elements. The game tasks players to survive in the wilderness by crafting items using the materials they gather or steal; the player starts with only a rock and a torch. There is only a multiplayer mode and a prevalent concept in Rust is to form and join clans with other players. Raiding is a very common action, usually done in large clans. Since Rust's first alpha launch, animals, hunting and the ability to craft armor and weapons have been added. It initially featured zombies as enemies, but subsequently replaced them with bears and wolves. Radiation was also removed due to the frustration it was causing players. Throughout Rust's alpha release, it was met with mixed critic reviews and many comparisons with other survival games were made, with the most common one being the mixture between DayZ and Minecraft. Reviewers praised the game's concept and gameplay, while also noting the obvious unfinishedness. By the end of 2015, Rust had sold over three million copies."@en ;

In contrast to other fighting games at the time, which were set in modern times and focused primarily on hand-to-hand combat, Samurai Shodown is set in feudal-era Japan (similar to Kaneko's Shogun Warriors) and was one of the first fighting games to focus primarily on weapon-based combat after the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II."@en .

It was released on February 28, 1997 in North America only, though it is region-free. It is unusual in that it can be played as a run and gun game, or with a light gun. The main characters and plotline are mostly the same from the comic series. The storyline revolves around Scud, a Heart Breaker Series 1373 model assassin, a fictional type of robotic assassin, his partner, Drywall, a bizarre character whose body can hold an unlimited amount of storage space, Sussudio, a bounty hunter that at first tries to kill Scud, and several other characters from the series."@en ;

It was re-released via emulation services such as the Wii's Virtual Console and Microsoft Windows in 2010, and was also included in the North American version of Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. It is the second game in the Shinobi series released for the Mega Drive, following The Revenge of Shinobi. However, it is not a continuation of the previous game, but rather a loose adaptation to the 1989 arcade game Shadow Dancer. Like in the original arcade game, the player controls a ninja followed by a canine companion. The Secret of Shinobi was well received by critics."@en ;

It was published by Atlus in 2009 in Japan, and in 2010 in North America. It is the fourth entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series, which forms the core of the Megami Tensei franchise. The story follows a special task force sent by the United Nations to investigate the Schwarzwelt, a spatial distortion that appears in Antarctica and threatens to engulf the world. Players take control of an unnamed protagonist, navigating the environments of the Schwarzwelt in first-person. Combat involves the player and recruited demons fighting against various enemies, with the protagonist having the option of talking with and recruiting enemies. The game originated from the team's wish to develop a large-scale role-playing game for the DS. Many of the main staff had worked on previous Megami Tensei titles in some capacity, including producer and designer Kazuma Kaneko, director Eiji Ishida, writer Shogo Isogai, and composer Shoji Meguro. The setting in Antarctica was chosen to appeal to an overseas audience. Alongside the new setting, the game featured multiple science fiction elements new to the series, taking inspiration from films such as Damnation Alley and The Thing. For the music, Meguro used grander musical styles than his previous works, incorporating choir music using a special synthesizer. Reception of the game has been generally positive for its story and gameplay, but many disliked its first-person navigation."@en ;

It was ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable platforms, and these versions were released in January 2010. In April 2014, it appeared on the PlayStation Network in Europe. The game serves as a reimagining of the first installment. Shattered Memories retains the premise of the original game—Harry Mason's quest to find his missing daughter in the fictitious American town of Silent Hill—but is set in a different fictional universe, has a different plot, and altered characters, alongside new ones. Five endings are available. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to an alternate dimension. Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey. After designing the Silent Hill prequel (2007), which intentionally replicated elements of the first installment, Climax Studios wanted to try a different approach to creating a title in the series. Among the changes made was the removal of combat and the constant presence of monsters. Akira Yamaoka composed the soundtrack of the game, which was the first in the series to prominently feature dynamic music. The game received generally positive reviews, and its graphics, storyline, voice acting, soundtrack, and use of the Wii Remote were praised by reviewers. Some reviewers criticized Shattered Memories' chase sequences and duration, which they deemed potentially frustrating and short."@en ;

It was developed by EA Black Box and released in 2007 on these dates: in North America on September 17 for the Xbox 360 and September 24 for the PS3; and in Europe on September 28 for the Xbox 360 and October 5 for the PS3. As of February 1, 2008, Skate has outsold the 2007 skateboarding game Tony Hawk's Proving Ground by a ratio of almost 2 to 1. Two sequels, Skate 2 and Skate 3, have been released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as well as Skate It, a spin-off for the Wii, Nintendo DS and iOS platforms. Despite immense commercial and critical success, EA has yet to announce a fourth installment for the eighth generation of video game consoles, although fans have begun pressuring EA on social media to release it."@en ;

The mission of the game is to fly solo over several states, delivering bags of mail. The game supported a fairly realistic flight model (for the time), and a large number of flight instruments were available. A map covering many states of the US was used, which even included altitude data (although the landscape always appeared flat due to the technology constraints of the time)."@en .

It was originally released as an expansion set for Microsoft Windows and is included within the Morrowind: Game of the Year edition for Xbox. Unlike the first expansion Tribunal, which added a city separate from the world map consisting of interior cells, Bloodmoon adds a large new island to the original world map, a cold northern territory named Solstheim. Rather than the Dunmer (dark elves) that are the indigenous race in the nearby Vvardenfell, Solstheim is populated largely by the Nord race. This is largely because the island sits more or less astride the border between Morrowind and the Nord homeland of Skyrim. This expansion adds new enemies, the East Empire Company as a joinable guild, and the possibility to become a werewolf, akin to the inclusion of vampires seen in Morrowind. Bloodmoon also uses larger and more detailed environments, including snowfall, thus raising the computer hardware requirements, though the ash storms of the original game are much more graphically demanding than the snow of Bloodmoon. As with Morrowind and Tribunal, Bloodmoon has many side-quests to finish and many caves to explore aside from its main quest. Unlike Tribunal, which is intended to be played after the completion of Morrowind's main quest, Bloodmoon's main-quest is self-contained within the expansion."@en ;

It was published on all platforms by WB Games. The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy; The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). Set fifteen years after the War of the Ring, the game features Samwise Gamgee telling his children of the adventures of Aragorn during the conflict; his stories form the majority of the game's content. Aragorn's Quest was the first Lord of the Rings game released by WB Games, who had acquired the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema film series from Electronic Arts in 2009. The game was aimed primarily at younger players, offering a simplified and less violent version of the plots of the three films. It received mixed to negative reviews, with critics finding the combat repetitive, the narrative too truncated and the overall game too easy."@en ;

Your Sims will have fun taking up a variety of creative, intellectual, or active leisure-time pursuits. They can even meet Sims that share their interests and expand their social relationships. Develop your Sims' skills while they pursue their true pastime passions. Will your Sims stumble reaching for new goals or find a new sense of fulfillment?\" With this expansion, Sims can pursue employment in five new careers including dance, entertainment, intelligence, oceanography and architecture. The ten hobbies included in the expansion pack are fitness, cooking, music/dance, sports, nature, science, films/literature, gaming, tinkering, and arts/crafts. Every Sim is created with a predetermined \"preferred\" hobby which cannot be modified by the player. While the bar is filled, the Sim is \"in the zone\", shown graphically as a white glow around the Sim; causing their needs to decay more slowly than usual, as to allow extra time on that hobby."@en ;

Though originally slated for release in the fall of 2004, it was delayed until the following spring when it came out for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Microsoft Windows. Handheld versions for the Nintendo DS, Mobile phone and N-Gage were also released. A Game Boy Advance port was planned, but later cancelled. Chaos Theory is the third game in the Splinter Cell series endorsed by novelist Tom Clancy. As with previous entries in the franchise, Chaos Theory follows the activities of Sam Fisher, an agent working for a covert-ops branch within the NSA called \"Third Echelon\". The game has a significantly darker tone than its predecessors, featuring more combat and the option for Fisher to kill people he interrogates as opposed to simply knocking them out. As a result, it was the first Splinter Cell game to receive an M-rating by the ESRB, an assessment which has since been applied to all subsequent releases in the series. Actor Michael Ironside reprised his role as Fisher, while Don Jordan returned from the original game to voice Third Echelon director Irving Lambert, having been replaced by Dennis Haysbert in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. Chaos Theory was an instant commercial success, selling 2.5 million units across all platforms within a month of its release. The Xbox and PC versions of the game received near-universal acclaim from critics and fans alike; the GameCube and PlayStation 2 iterations were also released to generally positive reviews. Official Xbox Magazine named it the Xbox \"Game of the Year\" (2005) for its strong gameplay and lifelike graphics. A remastered HD edition was bundled with the first two games of the series as part of the Splinter Cell Trilogy for the PlayStation 3, released on December 20, 2010. Another port titled Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D was released for the Nintendo 3DS on March 25, 2011."@en ;

It is the official successor to Rail Simulator, and was released online on 12 June 2009 and in stores on 3 July 2009. Compared to Rail Simulator, RailWorks contained new rolling stock, tools that previously had to be downloaded separately, graphical advancements such as modification of the existing content, bug fixes, backwards compatibility and the ability to trade elements from the virtual world with other users online. The first release of RailWorks contained all of the five real-world routes of the original European and North American releases of Rail Simulator, and added three new fictional routes: a large UK goods yard, a route set in the Alpine region and a route based around Denver, Colorado. It is a Steamworks title, which means it uses and requires Steam to activate and to deliver core game updates. Steam is also used to deliver additional routes and locomotives in the form of DLC. The core game has received several free updates since release, including major new versions RailWorks 2: Train Simulator, RailWorks 3: Train Simulator 2012, Train Simulator 2013, Train Simulator 2014, Train Simulator 2015, Train Simulator 2016 and Train Simulator 2017 released between 2010 and 2016, respectively."@en ;

The game was manufactured three formats: standard upright, cabaret/mini, and a seated environmental/cockpit. All three versions feature a steering wheel, a gearshift for low and high gears, and an accelerator pedal. The screen is a vertically oriented 20-inch raster display. In addition to the on-screen display, Turbo features an LED panel to the left of the screen that displays the current player's score and the high score table. Turbo also features lighted oil and temperature gauges on either side of the steering wheel. Turbo was ported to the Colecovision and Intellivision home consoles."@en ;

It was released in 1997 in North America and Europe. Turok is an adaptation of the Acclaim Comics comic book series of the same name. The player controls a Native American warrior, Turok, who must stop the evil Campaigner from conquering the universe with an ancient and powerful weapon. As Acclaim's first exclusive title for the Nintendo 64, Turok was part of a strategy to develop games internally and license merchandise; Acclaim acquired the rights to Turok when it purchased Acclaim Comics (né Valiant) in 1994. Suffering from cash flow problems and falling sales, Acclaim came to rely on Turok as its best hope for a financial turnaround. Iguana pushed the Nintendo 64's graphics capabilities to its limits, and were forced to compress or cut elements to fit the game on its 8 megabyte cartridge. Bugs delayed the game's release from September 1996 to January 1997. Critical reception of Turok was highly positive. Becoming one of the most popular games for the console on release, Turok won praise for its graphics and evolution of the genre. Complaints centered on graphical slowdowns caused by multiple enemies appearing onscreen and occasionally awkward controls. The game sold 1.5 million copies and boosted sales of the Nintendo 64. Turok spawned a video game franchise that includes six sequels. A remastered version was released in digital stores on December 17, 2015."@en ;

The game features a single-player mode consisting of six levels where the player assumes the role of Turok as he tries to defeat a powerful alien entity called the Primagen. It also includes a multiplayer mode where various players can compete against each other in several game types. Turok 2 received very positive reviews from video game journalists and sold more than one million copies in the United States. Critics praised the arsenal of weapons and the length of the levels, but opinions were mixed on its inconsistent frame rate. A separate game, also titled Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, was released for the Game Boy Color in December 1998. Although set in the same fictional universe, it follows a different storyline. A sequel, Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion, was released in 2000. A remastered version of the game, developed by Night Dive Studios, is planned to be released for the Xbox One."@en ;

It is the first game in the Virtua Fighter series, and the first arcade fighting game to feature fully 3D polygon graphics. It has been ported to several platforms including the Sega Saturn, Sega 32X and Microsoft Windows. A critically acclaimed and hit game, Virtua Fighter was highly regarded for its in-depth fighting engine and real world fighting techniques, and has been revolutionary and highly influential in the evolution of the genre and video games in general. An update titled Virtua Fighter Remix by AM1 was released for the Saturn in 1995. The game's remake, Virtua Fighter 10th Anniversary, was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 as a stand-alone title in Japan and as a bonus to Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution in North America."@en .

It is the sixth game in the series, and is currently available in Japan, Europe, Australia and North America. It was released for Nintendo's DSiWare service, which started at the launch of the DSi on April 5, 2009 in North America. It is one of the first video games released for the DSiWare service in Japan, North America, and PAL regions. This is the first time that Wario has been featured for a console launch instead of Mario and one of two consecutive Wario Ware games for a handheld launch; the second being Wario Ware DIY being released during the DSi XL release in late March 2010. It contains only a fraction of the mini-games featured in previous entries in the WarioWare series, and does not feature any boss stages. It stars five of the characters from the WarioWare series, including Wario, Mona, Jimmy T., and Kat & Ana, each featuring their own microgames. This game makes use of the Nintendo DSi's front camera to control the microgames, using the head and sometimes one or both hands, similarly to Sony's EyeToy accessory. There have been reported problems with trying to play the game, that the camera could not recognize the player unless in desirable lighting conditions. This has fewer positive reviews than other WarioWare games."@en ;

The game was released in North American on November 1, 1994, and later released the following year in Japan on May 26. The game's soundtrack consists of music from the 1992 White Zombie album La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1. Developed by Naughty Dog for Universal Interactive Studios, Way of the Warrior features high resolution graphics, characters with detailed storylines, and ultra-violent finishing moves.
